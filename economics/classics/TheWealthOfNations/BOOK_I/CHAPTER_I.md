# CHAPTER Iï¼š OF THE DIVISION OF LABOUR

## Division of labour is the greate cause of its increased powers, as may be better understood from a particular example,
## such as pin-making.
## The effect is similar in all trades and also in the division of employments.
## The advantage is due to three circumstances,
## (1) improved dexterity,
## (2) saving of time
## and (3) application of machinery, invented by workmen,
## or by machine-makers and philosophers.
## Hence the universal opulence of a well-governed society,
## even the day-labourer's coat being the produce of a vast number of workmen.
