# CHAPTER II: OF THE PRINCIPLE WHICH GIVES OCCASION TO THE DIVISION OF LABOUR

## The division of labour arises from a propensity in human nature to exchange.
## This propensity is found in man alone.
## It is encouraged by self-interest and leads to division of labour,
## thus giving rise to difference of talent more important than the natural differences,
## and rendering those differences useful.
