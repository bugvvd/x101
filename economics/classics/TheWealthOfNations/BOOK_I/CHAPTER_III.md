# CHAPTER III: THAT THE DIVISION OF LABOUR IS LIMITED BY THE EXTENT OF THE MARKET

## Division of labour is limited by the extent of the power of exchanging.
## Various trades cannot be carried on except in towns.
## Water-carriage widens the market,
## and so the first improvements are on the seacoast or navigable rivers,
## for example among the ancient nations on the Mediterranean coast.
## Improvements first took place in Egypt,
## Bengal and China;
## while Africa, Tartary and Siberia, and also Bavaria, Austria and Hungary are backward.
