# CHAPTER IV: OF THE ORIGIN AND USE OF MONEY

## Division of labour being established, every man lives by exchanging.
## Difficulties of barter lead to the selection of one commodity as money,
## for example, cattle, salt, shells, cod, tobacco, sugar, leather and nails.
## Metals were eventually preferred because durable and divisible.
## Iron, copper, gold and silver,
## were at first used in unstamped bars,
## and afterwards stamped to show quantity and fineness;
## stamps to show fineness being introduced first,
## and coinage to show weight later.
## The names of coins originally expressed their weight.
## The next inquiry is waht rules determine exchangeable value.
## Value may mean either value in use or value in exchange.
## Three question,
## (1) wherein consists the real price of commodities,
## (2) what are the different parts of this price, (3) why the market price sometimes diverges from this price,
## will be answered in the next three chapters.
