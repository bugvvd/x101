# CHAPTER IX: OF THE PROFITS OF STOCK

## Profits depend on increase and decrease of weath,
## falling with the increase of wealth.
## The reate is difficult to ascertain, 
## but may be inferred from the rate of interest.
## which has fallen in England,
## while wealth has been increasing.
## Profits are lower in towns, where there is much stock, than in the country, where there is little.
## Interest is higher in Scotland, a poor country, than in England.
## So too in France,ca ocuntry probably less rich than England,
## but lower in Holland, which is richer than England. 
## In the peculiar case of new colonies high wages and high profits go together, but profits gradually diminish.
## New territories and trades may raise profits evern in a country advancing in riches.
## Diminution of capital stock raises profits.
## In a country as rich as it possibly could be, profits as well as wages would be very low,
## but there has never yet been any such country.
## Interest is raised by defective enforcement of contracts,
## and by prohibition.
## The lowest rate of profit must be more than enough to compensate loses,
## and so must the lowest rate of interest.
## In a country as rich as it possibly could be interest would be so low that only the wealthiest people could live on it.
## The highest rate of profit would eat up all rent and leave only wages.
## The proportion of interest to profit rises and falls with the rate of profit.
## Countries with low profits can sell as cheap as those with low wages; and in reality high profits tend to raise ## prices more than high wages.
