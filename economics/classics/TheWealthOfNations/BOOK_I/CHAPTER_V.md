# CHAPTER V: OF THE REAL AND NOMINAL PRICE OF COMMODITIES, OR OF THEIR PRICE IN LABOUR, AND THEIR PRICE IN MONEY

## Labour is the real measure of exchangeable value,
## and the first price paid for all things.
## Wealth is power of purchasing labour.
## But value is not commonly estimated by labour, because labour is difficullt to measure,
## and commodities are more frequently exchagned for other commodities,
## especially money, which is therefore more frequently used in estimating value.
## But gold and silver vary in value, sometimes coasting more and sometimes less labour, whereas equal labour always means equal sacrifice to the labourer,
## although the employer regards labour as varying in value.
## So regarded, labour has a real and a nominal price.
## The distinction between real and nominal is sometimes useful in practices,
## since the amount of metal in coins tends to diminish,
## and the value of gold and silver to fall.
## English rents reserved in money have fallen to a fourth since 1586,
## and similar Scotch and French rents almost to nothing.
## Corn rents are more stable than money rents, 
## but liable to much larger annual variations,
## so that labour is the only universal standard.
## But in ordinary transactions money is sufficient,
## being perfectly accurate at the same time and place,
## and the only thing to be considered in transactions between distant places.
## So it is no wonder that money price has been more attended to.
## In this work corn prices will sometimes be used.
## Several metals have been coined, but only one is used as the standard, and that usually the one first used in commerce,
## as the Romans used copper,
## and modern European nations silver.
## The standard metal orginally was the only legal tender,
## later the proportion between the values of the two metals is declared by law, and both are legal tender, the distinction between them ceasing to be of importance,
## except when a change is made in the regulated proportion.
## During the continuance of a regulated proportion, the value of the mose precious metal regulates the value of the whole coinage, as in Great Britain,
## where the reformation of the gold coin has raised the value of the silver coin.
## Silver is rated below its value in England.
## Locke's explanation of the high price of silver bullion is wrong.
## If the silver coin were reformed, it would be melted.
## Silver ought to be rated higher and should not be legal tender for more than a guinea.
## If it were properly rated, silver bullion would fall below the mint price without any recoinage.
## A seignorage would prevent melting and discourage exporatation.
## Fluctuations in the market price of gold and silver are due to ordinary commercial causes, but steady divergence from mint price is due to the state of the coin.
## The price of goods is adjusted to the actual contents of the coinage.
