# CHAPTER VI: OF THE COMPONENT PARTS OF THE PRICE OF COMMODITIES

## Quantity of labour is originally the only rule of value,
## allowance being made for superior hardship,
## and for uncommon dexterity and ingenuity.
## The while produce then belongs to the labourer,
## but when stock is used, something must be given for the profits of the undertaker, and the value of work resolves itself into wages and profits.
## Profits are not merely wages of inspection and direction.
## The labourer shares with the employer, and labour alone no longer regulates value.
## When landhas all become private property, rent constitutes a third component part of the price of most commodities.
## The real value of all three parts is meaured by labour.
## In an improved society all three parts are generally present,
## for example, in corn,
## in flour or meal,
## and in flax.
## Rent is a smaller proportion in highly manufactured commodities.
## A few commodities have only two or even one of the three component parts.
## But all must have at least one,
## and the price of the whole annual produce resolves itself into wages, profits and rent,
## which are the only original kinds of revenue.
## They are sometimes confounded,
## for example, gentaleman farmer's rent is called profit,
## a common farmer's wages are called profit,
## and so are an independent manufacturer's wages,
## while the rent and profit of a gardner cultivating his own land are considered earnings of labour.
## A great part of the annual produce goes to the idle; the proportion regulates the increase or diminution of the produce.
