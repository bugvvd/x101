# CHAPTER VII: OF THE NATURAL AND MARKET PRICE OF COMMODITIES

## Ordinary or average rates of wages, profit,
## and rent
## may be called natural rates,
## to pay which a commodity is sold at its natural price,
## or for what it really costs, which includes profit,
## since no one will go on selling without profit.
## Market price
## is regulated by the quantity brought to market and the effectual demand.
## When the quantity brought falls short of the effectual demand, the market price rises above the natural;
## when it exceeds the effectural demand the market price falls below the natural;
## when it is just equal to the effectual demand the market and natural price coincide.
## It nautally suits itself to the effectual demand.
## When it exceeds that demand, some of the component parts of its price are below their natural rate;
## when it falls short, some of the component parts are above their natural rate.
## Natural price is the central price to which actual prices gravitate.
## Industry suits itself to the effectual demand,
## but the quantity produced by a given amount of industry sometimes flucutates.
## The fluctuations fall on wages and profit more than on rent,
## affecting them in different proportions according to the supply of commodities and labour.
## But market price may be kept above natural for a long time,
## in consequence of want of general knowledge of high profits,
## or in consequence of secrets in manufactures,
## which my operate for long periods,
## or in consequence of scarcity of peculiar soils,
## which may continue forever.
## A monopoly has the same effect as a trade secret,
## the price of monopoly being the highest which can be got.
## Corporation privileges, etc, are enlarged monoplies.
## Market price is seldom long below natural price,
## though apprenticeship and corporation laws sometimes reduce wages much below the natural rate for a certain period.
## Natural price varies with the natural rate of wages, profit and rent.
## Wages wukk ve dealt with in chapter viii.,
## profit in chapter ix.,
## difference of wages and profit in chapter x.,
## and rent in chapter xi.
