# CHAPTER VIII: OF THE WAGES OF LABOUR

## Produce is the natural wages of labour.
## Originally the whole belonged to the labourer.
## If this had continued, all things would have become cheaper,
## though in appearance many things might have become dearer.
## This state was ended by the appropriation of land and accumulation of stock,
## rent being the first deduction,
## and profit the second, both in agriculture,
## and other arts and manufactures.
## The independent workman gets profits as well as wages,
## but this case is infrequent.
## Wages depend on contract between masters and workmen.
## The masters have the advantage,
## though less is heard of masters' combinations than of workmen's.
## But masters can not reduce wages below a certain rate, namely, subsistence for a man and something over for a family.
## Wages may be considerably above this rate,
## when there is an increasing demand for labourers,
## which is caused by an increase of the funds destined for the payment of wages. The funds consist of
## suplus revenue,
## and suplus stock.
## Th demand for labourers therefore increases with the increase of national wealth.
## High wages are occasioned by the increases, not by the actural greatness of national wealth.
## North America is more thriving than Englabnd.
## Wages are not high in a stationary country however rich.
## China is not going backwards and labourers there keep up their numbers.
## In a declining country this would not be the case.
## In Great Britian wages are above the lowest rate,
## since (1) there is a difference between winter and summer wages,
## (2) wages do not fluctuate with the price of provisions,
## (3) wages vary more from place to place than the price of provisions,
## and (4) frequently wages and the price of provisions vary in opposite directions, as grain is cheaper and wages are higher in England than in Scotland;
## and in the last century grain was dearer and wages were lower than in this;
## while other necessaries and conveniencies have also become cheaper.
## High earnings of labour are an advantage to the society.
## Poverty does not prevent births,
## but is unfavourable to the rearing of children,
## and so restrains multiplication,
## while the liberal reward of labour encourages it
## as the wear and tear of the free man must be paid for just like that of the slave, though not so extravagantly.
## High wages increase population.
## The progressive state is the best for the labouring poor.
## High wages encourage industry.
## The opinion that cheap years encourage idleness is erroneous.
## Wages are high in cheap years,
## and low in dear years,
## so that masters commend dear years.
## Messance shows that in some French manufactures more is produced in cheap years.
## No connexion is visible between dearness or cheapness of the years and the variations in Scotch linen and Yorkshire woolen manufactures.
## The produce depends on other circumstances, and more of it esxapes beging reconed in cheap years.
## There is, however, a connexion between the price of labour and that of provisions.
## In years of plenty there is a greater demand for labout,
## and in years of scarcity a less demandm
## and the effect of variations in the price of provisions is this conterbalanced.
## Increase of wages increase prices, but the cause of increased wages tends to diminish prices.
