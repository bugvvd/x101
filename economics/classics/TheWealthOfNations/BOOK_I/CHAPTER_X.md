# CHAPTER X: OF WAGES AND PROFIT IN THE DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENTS OF LABOUR AND STOCK

## Advantages and disadvantages tend to equiality where there is perfect liberty.
## Actual differences of pecuniary wages and profits are due partly to conterbalancing circumstances and partly to want of perfect liberty.
## PART I: INEQUALITIES ARISING FROM THE NATURE OF THE EMPLOYMENT THEMSELVES
## There are five counterbalancing circumstances:
## (1) Wages vary with the agreeableness of the employment
## Some very agreeable emplyments are exceedingly ill paid.
## The same thing is true of profits.
## (2) Wages vary with the cost of learning the business.
## The cost of apprenticeship accounts for thewages of manufacturers being higher than those of country labourers.
## Education for liberal professions is more costly and the pecuniary recompense consequently higher. Profits are not much affected by this circumstance.
## (3) Wages vary with constancy of employment.
## (4) Wages vary with the trust to be reposed.
## Profits areunaffected by trust.
## (5) Wages vary with the probability of success.
## Law and similar professions are nevertheless crowded.
## Public admiration makes a part of the reward of superior abilities,
## except in the peculiar case of players, pera singers, &c.
## The greater part of men have an over-weening conceit of their abilities:
## lotteries show that the chance of gain is overvalued,
## and the moderate profit of insurers shows that the chance of loss is undervalued.
## Young people are particulaly prone to overvalue the chance of gain and undervalue the risk of loss.
## For this reason soldiers are poorly paid,
## and sailors not much better.
## Dangers which can be surmounted attract, though mere unwholesomeness repels.
## Profits vary with certainty of return.
## Profits are less unequal than wages, and their inequality is often only due to the inclusion of wages,
## as in the case of the profit of an apothecary,
## or country grocer.
## The greater difference between retail and wholesale profits in town than country is due to the same cause.
## The lesser rate of profit in towns yields larger fortunes, but there mostly arise from speculation.
## The five circumstances thus counterbalance difference of pecuniary gains,
## but three things are necessary as well as perfect freedom:
## (1) the employments must be well known as long established,
## since new trades yield higher wages,
## and higher profits:
## (2) the employments must be in their natural state,
## since the demand for labour in each employment varies from time to time
## and profits fluctuate with the price of the commodity produced:
## and (3) the employments must be principal employment of those who occupy them, sice people maintained by on employment will work cheap at another, like the Scotch cotters,
## Shetland knitters,
## Scotch linen spinners,
## and London lodging house keepers.
## PART II: INEQUALITIES OCCASIONED BY THE POLICY OF EUROPE
## The policy of Europe occasions more important inequalities
## in three ways:
## (1) It restricts competition in some employments,
## principally by giving exclusive privileges to corporations, which require long apprenticeship and limit the number of apprentices.
## Seven years is the usual period of apprenticeship.
## The Statute of Apprenticeship, which required it everywhere in England, has been confined to market towns,
## and to trades existing when it was passed.
## The term varies in France,
## and Scotland, where the regulations are less oppressive.
## All such regulations are as impertinent as oppressive.
## Long apprenticeships are no security against bad work,
## and do not form young people to industry.
## Apprenticeships were unknown to the ancients.
## Long apprenticeships are altogether unnecessary.
## Corporations were established to keep up prices and consequently wages and profit;
## by means of which the towns gained at the expense of the country,
## being enabled to get the produce of a larger quantity of country labour in exchange for the produce of a smaller quantity of their own,
## as the exports of a town are the real price of its imports.
## That town industry is better paid is shown by the large fortunes made in it.
## Combination is easy to the inhabitants of a town,
## and difficult to those of the country, who are dispersed and not governed by the corporation spirit. No apprenticeship is prescribed for farming, though a difficult, art,
## or for the inferior branches of country labour, which require more skill than most mechanic trades.
## The superiority of town industry is enhanced by other regulations, such as high duties on foreign manufactures.
## The superiorty has declined in Great Britain.
## Meetings of people in the same trade ought not to be facilitated, as by registration of traders,
## by the establishment of funds for the sick, widows and orphance, 
## or by incorporation.
## Coporations are unnecessary, and corrupt the workmen.
## (2) The policy of Europe increases competition in some trades.
## It cheapens the education of the clergy and thereby reduces their earnings;
## so that it is only the great benefices, etc., which support the honour of the English and Roman Catholic Churches.
## The same causes, if present, would lower the reward of lawyers and physicians, 
## as it has done that of men of letters,
## ahd that of teachers,
## who were much better paid in ancient times.
## Perhaps this cheapness of teaching is no disadvantage to the public.
## (3) The policy of Europe obstructs the free circulation of labour.
## Apprenticeship and corporation privileges obstruct circulation from employment to employment and from place to place.
## So that the changes of employmnet necessary to equalise wages are prevented.
## What obstructs the circulation of labour also obstructs that of stock.
## In Engliand the circulation of labour is further obstructed by the poor law.
## Each parish was to support its own poor under 43 Eliz., c.2;
## these were determined by 13 and 14 Car.II. to be such as had resided forty days, within which time, however, a new inhabitant might be removed.
## Notice in writing was required from the new inhabitant by 1 James II.
## Such notice was to be published in church under 3 W.III.
## There were four other ways of gaining a settlement,
## two of which were impossible to all poor men,
## and the other two to all married men,
## and to all independent workmen.
## Certificates were invented to enable persons to reside in a parish without being immediately removable and without gainning a settlement.
## Certificates were required by the new parish but refused by the old.
## The courts declined to force overseers to give a certificate.
## This law is the cause of the very unequal price of labour in England,
## and an evident violation of natural liberty, thgouth tamely sumitted to.
## Wages were anciently rated by law of by justices of peace.
## London taylors' wages are still rated by law.
## Attempts were also made to regulated profits by fixing prices, and the assize of bread still remains.
## The inequialities of wages and profits are not much affected by the advancing or declining state of the society.
