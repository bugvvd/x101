# CHAPTER XI: OF THE RENT OF LAND

## Rent is the produce which is over what is necessary to pay the farmer ordinary profit
## It is not merely interest on stock laid out in improvements,
## and is sometimes obtained for land incapable of improvement, such as rocks where kelp grows;
## and for the opportunity to fish.
## It is therefore a monopoly price.
## Whether particular parts of produce fetch a price sufficient to yield a rent depends on the demand.
## Some parts are always in sufficient demand; others sometimes are and sometimes are not.
## Wages and profit are causes of price; rent is an effect
what effect?
## The chapter is divided into three parts.
## PART I: OF THE PRODUCE OF LAND WHICH ALWAYS AFFORDS RENT
## Food can always purchase as much labour as it can maintain.
## Almost all land produces more than enough food to maintain the labour and pay the profits, and therefore yields rent.
## The rent varies with situation as well as with fertility.
## Good roads, etc., diminishs differences of rent.
## Corn land yields a larger supply of food after maintaining labour than pasture.
## In early times meat is cheaper than bread,
## but later on it becomes dearer,
## and pasture yields as good a rent as corn land,
## and some times a greater on,
## as in the neighpourhood of a great town,
## or all over a populous country which imports corn, such as Holland and ancien Italy,
## and occasionally in a country where enclosure is unusual.
## Irdinarily the rent of corn land regulates that of pasture.
## Improved methods of feeding cattle lower meat in proportion to beard.
## The price of meat was higher at the beginning of the seventeenth century
## than in 1763-74;
## whereas wheat was cheaper.
## The rent and profit of corn land and pasture regulate those of all other land.
## The apparently greater rent or profit of some other kinds is only interest on greater expense,
## as in hop, and fruit gardens;
## kitchen gardens;
## and vineyard.
## Land fitted for a particular produce may have a monopoly,
## such as that which produces wine of a particular flavour,
## or the West Indian sugar colonies,
## and in a less degree the tobacco plantation of Virgina and Maryland.
## So the rent of cultivated land producing food regulates that of most of the rest,
## and in Europe the rent of corn land regulates that of other cultivated land producing food.
## If the common food was such as to produce a greater surplus, rent would be higher:
## for example, rice,
## or potatoes.
## Wheat is probably a better food than oats,
## but not than potatoes.
## Potatoes however, are perishable.
## PART II: OF THE PRODUCE OF LAND WHICH SOMETIMES DOES, AND SOMETIMES DOES NOT, AFFORD RENT
## The materials of cloathing and lodging, at first super-abundant, come in time to afford a rent.
## For example, hides and wool,
## stone and timber.
## Population depends on food;
## so the demand for the materials of cloathing and lodging is increased by greater ease of obtaining food,
## which thus makes them afford rent.
## They do not, however, even then always afford rent:
## for example, some coal-mines are too barren to afford rent,
## or too disadvantageously situated.
## The price of coal is kept down by that of wood,
## which varies with the state of agriculture.
## But in the coal countries coal is everywhere much below this price.
## The lowest possible price is that which only replaces stock with profits.
## Rent forms a smaller proportion of the price of coal than of that of most other rude produce.
## The situation of a metallic mine is less important than that of a coal mine,
## metals from all parts of the world being brought into competition.
## Rent has therefore a small share in the price of metals.
## Tine and lead mines pay a sixth in Cornwall and Scotland.
## The silver mines of Peru formerly paid a fifth,
## and now only a tenth,
## while profits are small.
## Mining is encouraged in Peru by the interest of the sovereign.
## The gold mines of Peru now pay only a twentieth in rent.
## The lowest price of the precious metals must replace stock with ordinary profits,
## but their highest price is determined by their scarcity.
## The demand for them arises from their utility and beauty:
## and the merit of beauty is enhanced by their scarcity.
## The demand for precious stones arises altogether from their beauty enhanced by their enhanced by their scarcity.
## The rent of mines of precious metals and precious stones is in proportion to their relative and not to their absolute fertility.
## Abundant supplies would add little to the wealth of the world.
## But in estates above ground both produce and rent are regulated by absolute fertility.
## Abundance of food raises the value of other produce.
## PART III: OF THE VARIATIONS IN THE PROPORTION BETWEEN THE RESPECTIVE VALUES OF THAT SORT OF PRODUCE WHICH ALWAYS AFFORD RENT, AND OF THAT WHICH SOMETIMES DOES AND SOMETIMES DOES NOT AFFORD RENT
## The general course of progress is for produce other than food to become dearer,
## but there are interruptions,
## as in the case of silver,
## when new fertile mines are discovered.
## Silver would grow dearer in the general process of improvement,
## but might grow cheaper if some accident increased the supply for many years together:
## or remain stationary if demand and supply increased equally.
## These three things have happed during the last 400 years.
## DIGRESSION CONCERNING THE VARIATIONS IN THE VALUE OF SILVER DURING THE COURSE OF THE FOUR LAST CENTURIES
## EFFECTS OF THE PROGRESS OF IMPROVEMENT UPON THE REAL PRICE OF MANUFACTURES
## But the natural effect of improvement is to diminish the price of manufactures.
## In a few manufactures the rise in the price of raw material counterbalances improvement in execution,
## but in other cases price falls considerably. Since 1600 this has been most remarkable in manufactures made of the coarser metals.
## Clothing has not fallen much in the same period,
## but very considerably since the fifteenth century.
## Fine cloth has fallen to less than one-third of its price in 1487,
## and coarse cloth has fallen to less than one half of its price in 1463.
## Hose have fallen very considerably since 1463.
## when they were made of common cloth.
## The machinery for making cloth has been much improved,
## which explains the fall of price.
## The coarse manufacture was a household one,
## but the fine was carried on in Flanders by people who subsisted on it, and was subject to customs duty,
## which explains why the coarse was in those times lower in proportion to the fine.
## CONCLUSION OF THE CHAPTER
## Every improvement in the circumstances of society raises rent.
## Extension of improvement and cultivation raises it directly,
## and so does the rise in the price of cattle, &c.
## Improvements which reduce the price of manufactures raise it indirectly,
## and so does every increase in the quantity of useful labour employed.
## The contrary curcumstances lower rent.
## There are three parts of produce and three original orders of society.
## The interest of the proprietors of land is inseparably connected with the general interest of the society.
## So also is that of those who live by wages,
## but the interest of those who live by profit has not the same connextion with the genral interest of the society.
