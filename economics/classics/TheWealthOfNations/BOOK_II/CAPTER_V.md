# CHAPTER V: OF THE DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENT OF CAPITALS

## The quantity of labour put in mothion and the value added to the annual produce by capitals vary with their employment.
## There are four different ways of employment capital, 
## all of which are necessary:
## (1) procuring rude produce,
## (2) manufacturing,
## (3) transportation,
## and (4) distribution.
## The employers of such capitals are productive labourers:
## the capital of the retailer employs only himself;
## the capital of the merchant employes sailors and carriers;
## the capital of the manufacturer employs his workmen;
## the capital of the farmer employs his servants and his cattle, and adds a much greater value to the annual produce than other capital.
## Capitals employed in agriculture and retail trade must reside within the country;
## the capital of the merchant ay reside anywhere;
## the capital of the manufacturer must be where the manufacture is, but that is not necessarily determined.
## Whether the merchant who exports belongs to the country or not makes little difference.
## The capital of the manufacturer will put into motion more native labour if it resides within the country, but may be useful evenif outside it.
## Particular countries often have not enough capital for cultivation, manufactures, and transportation.
## In such cases the larger the proportion employed in agriculture, the larger will be the annual produce.
## The quickest way to make the capitl sufficient for all these purposes is to begin with the most profitable.
## That they have done so is the principal cause of the progress of the American colonies.
## Great countries have scarcely ever acquired sufficient capital for all those purposes.
## Different kinds of wholesale trade employ different quantities of productive labour and add differnet amoutns to the annual produce.
## There are three different kinds of trade: home, foreign and carrying.
## Capital employed in buying in one part of the country to sell in another replaces tow domestic capitals.
## Capital employed in importation replaces one domestic and one foreign capital.
## Its returns are not so quick as those of home trade.
## Roundabout foreign trade has the same effect as direct.
## Foreign trade carried on by means of gold and silver is in no way different from the rest.
## Capital employed in the carrying trade replaces two foreign capitals.
## It my employ ships andsaliors belonging to the country, but his is not always the case,
## and equal capital employed in importation or coasting trade may employ as many ships and men.
## Capital in home trade therefore supports more productive labour than capital employed in foreign trade, which, however, supports more than capital in the carrying trade.
## Political economy ought consequently not to allure capital into the foreign or the carrying trade
## though each is advantageous when naturally introduced.
## The surplus of the produce of particulare branches of inudstry must be sent abroad.
## Foreign goods obtained in exchange must often be re-exported. When the other emplyments are full, the surplus capital disgorges itself into the carrying trade, which is a symptom rather than a cause of great national wealth.
## The possible extent of the carrying trade is much the greatest.
## Agriculture does not yield sufficient profit to attract all the capital which it might absorb.
## The reason will be explained in the next two books.
