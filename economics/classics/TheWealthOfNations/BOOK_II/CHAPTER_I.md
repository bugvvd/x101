# CHAPTER I: OF THE DIVISION OF STOCK

## A man does not think of obtaining revenue from a small stock,
## but when he has more than enough for immediate consumption, he endeavours to derive a revenue from the rest,
## using it either as,
## (1) circulating capital,
## or (2) fixed capital.
## Diffrerent proportions of fixed and circulationg capital are required in different trades.
## The stock of a society is divided in the same way into
## (1) the portion reserved for immediate consumption,
## (2) the fixed capital, which consists of
## (a) useful machines,
## (b) profitable buildings,
## (c) improvements of land,
## and (d) acquired and useful abilities,
## and (3) the circulating capital, which consists of,
## (a) the money
## (b) the stock of provisions in the possession of the sellers,
## (c) the materials of clothes, furniture, and buildings,
## and (d) completed work in the hands of the merchant or manufacturer.
## The last three parts of the circulating capital are regularly withdrawn from it.
## Every fixed capital is derived from and supported by a circulating capital,
## and cannot yield any revenue without it.
## The end of both fix ed and circulating capital is to maintain and augment the orther part of the stock.
## The circulating capital is kept up by the produce of land, mines, and fisheries,
## which require both fixed and circulating capitals to cultivate them,
## and, when their fertility is equal, yield produce proportionate to the capital employed.
## Where there is tolerable security all stock is employed in one or other of the three ways.
## But in countries where violence pervails much stock is buried and concealed.
