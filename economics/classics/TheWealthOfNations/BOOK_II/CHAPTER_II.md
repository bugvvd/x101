# CHAPTER II: OF MONEY CONSIDERED AS A PARTICULAR BRANCH OF THE GENERAL STOCK OF THE SOCIETY, OR OF THE EXPENCE OF MAINTAINING THE NATIONAL CAPITAL

## Price are divided into three parts, wages, profits, and rent,
## and the whole annual produce is divided into the same three parts;
## but we may distinguish between gross and net revenue.
## Gross rent is the whole sum paid by the farmer; net rent what is left free to the land lord.
## Gross revenue is the whole annual produce: net revenue what is left free after deducting the maintenance of fixed and circulating capital.
## The whole expence of maintaining the fixed capital must be excluded,
## since the only object of the fixed capital is to increase the productive power of labour,
## and any cheapening or siplification is regarded as a good.
## The cost of maintaining the fixed capital is like the cost of repairs on an estate,
## but the expence of maintaining the last three parts of the circulating capital is not to be deducted,
## the circulating capital of the society being different in this respect from that of an individual.
## The maintenance of the money alone must be deducted.
## The money resembles the fixed capital, since
## (1) the maintenance of the stock of money is part of the gross but not of the net revenue,
## and (2) the money itself forms no part of the net revenue.
## It only appears to do so from the ambiguity of language,
## sums of money being often used to indicate the goods purchasable as well as the coins themselves.
## We must not add both together.
## If a man has a guinea a week he enjoys a guinea;s worth of subsistence, &c.
## and his real revenue is that subsistence, &c.
## The same is true of all the inhabitants of a country.
## The coins annually paid to an individual often equal his revenue, but the stock of coin in a society is never equal to its whole revenue.
## Money is therefore no part of the revenue of the society.
## (3) Every saving in the cost of maintaining the stock of money is an improvement.
## The substitution of paper for gold money is an improvement.
## Bank notes are the best sort of paper money.
## When a banker lends out £100,000 in notes and keeps in hand only £20,000 in gold and silver, £80,000 in gold and silver is spared from the circulation;
## and if many bankers do the same, four-fifths of the gold and silver previously circulating may be sent abroad,
## and exchanged for goods,
## either to supply the consumption of another country, in which case the profit will be an addition to the net ## revenue of the country,
## or to supply home consumption (1) of luxuries, (2) of materials, tools and provisions wherewith industrious people are maintained and employed.
## If to supply luxuries, prodigality and consumption are increased;
## if to supply materials, &c., a permanent fund for supporting consumption is provided.
## The greater part of the gold and silver sent abroad purchase materials, &c.
## The quantity of industry which the circulating capital can employ is determined by the provisions, materials, and finished work, and not at al by the quantity of money.
## The substitution of paper for gold and silver increases the materials, tools, and maintenance at the expence of ## the gold and silver money.
## The quantity of money bears a small proportion to the whole produce, but a large one to that part destined to maintain industry.
## An operation of this kind has been carried out in Scotland with excellent effects.
## There was a t the Union at least a million sterling of gold and silver money, and now there is not half a million.
## Notes are ordinarily issued by discounting bills,
## but the Scotch banks invented the system of cash accounts,
## which enable them to issue notes readily,
## and make it possible for every merchant to carry on a greater trade than the otherwise could.
## The Scotch banks can of course discount bills when required.
## The whole of the paper money can never exceed the gold and silver which would have been required in its absence.
## The peculiar expense of a bank are (1) the keeping and (2) the replenishing of a stock of money with which to repay notes.
## A bank which issues too much paper will much increase both the first
## and the second expense,
## ans may be shown by an example.
## Banks have sometimes not understood this,
## e.g., the Bank of England,
## and the Scotch banks.
## The excessive circulation was caused by overtrading.
## A bank ought not to advance more thant the amount which merchants would otherwise have to keep by them in cash.
## This limite is ovserved when only real bills of exchange are discounted.
## Cash accounts should be carefully watched to secure the same end,
## as they were for a long time by the Scotch banks, which required frequent and regular operations,
## and this (1) were able to judge of the circumstances of their debtors,
## and (2) were secured against issuing too much paper.
## Bankers' loans ought to be only for moderate periods of time.
## More than twenty-five years ago the proper amount of paper money had been reached in Scotland,
## but the traders were not content,
## and some of them resorted to drawing and redrawing,
## which shall be explained.
## Bills of exchange have extrodinary legal privileges.
## So two persons, one in London and one inEdinburgh, would draw bills on each other.
## Much money was raised in this expensive way/
## The bill on London would be discounted in Edinburgh, and the bill on Edinburgh discounted in London,
## and each was always replaced by another.
## The amount thus advanced by the banks was in excess of the limit laid down above but this was not perceived at first.
## When the banks found it out they made difficulties about discounting,
## which alarmed and enraged the projectors;
## then Ayr bank was established and advanced money very freely,
## but soon got into difficulties,
## and was obliged to stop in two years.
## Its action and failure increased the distress of projectors and the country generally,
## but relieved the other Scotch banks.
## Another plan would have been to raise money on the securities pledged by borrowers:
## this would have been a losing business,
## and even if profitable would have been hurtful to the country.
## Law's scheme has been sufficiently explained by Du Verney and Du Tot.
## The bank of England was established in 1694,
## enlarged its sotck in 1697,
## in 1708,
## in 1709 and 1710,
## in 1717 and later.
## The rate of interest received by it from the public has been reduced from 8 to 3 per cent. and its dividend has lately been 51 1/2 per cent.
## It acts as a greate engine of state.
## The operations of banking turn dead stock into productive capital,
## but make commerce and industry somewhat less secure.
## Precautions should be taken to prevent the greater part of the circulation being filled with paper.
## Circulation may be divided into that between dealers and that between deals and consumers.
## The circulation of paper may be confined to the former by not allowing notes for small sums.
## The issue of such notes enables mean people to become bankers.
## None for less than £5 should be issued.
## This would secure the circulation of plenty of gold and silver,
## and would not prevent banks from giving sufficient assistance to traders.
## A law against small notes would be a violation of natural liberty necessary for the security of the society.
## Paper money payable on demand is equal to gold and silver,
## and does not raise prices;
## but paper not repayable on demand would fall below gold and silver,
## as happend in Scotland during the prevalence of the Optional Clause,
## and must have happended in regard to the Yorkshire currencies when small sums were repayable in guineas.
## The North American paper currencies consisted of government notes repayable at a distant date,
## and depreciated the currency to a greate degree.
## They were therefore justly prohibited.
## Pennsylvania was moderate in its issues, and its currency never went below the real par.
## The colo9nial paper was somewhat supported by being received in payment of taxes.
## A requirement that certain taxes should be paid in particular paper money might give that paper a certain value even if it was irredeemable.
## A paper currency depreciated below the value of the coin does not sink the value of gold and silver.
## The only restrictions on bankin gwhich are necessary are the prohibition of small bank notes and the requirement ## hat all notes shall be repaid on demand.
