# CHAPTER III: OF THE ACCUMULATION OF CAPITAL, OR OF PRODUCTIVE AND UNPRODUCTIVE LABOUR

## There are two sorts of labour, productive and unproductive.
## Many kinds of labour besides menial service are unproductive.
## The proportion of the produce employed in maintaining productive hands determines the next year's produce
## Part of the produce replaces capital, part constitutes profit and rent.
## That which replaces capital employs none but productive hands,
## while unproductive hands and those who do not labour are supported by revenue.
## So the proportion of productive hands depends on the proportion bwtween profit with rent and the part of produce which replaces capital.
## Rent anciently formed a larger proportion of the produce of agriculture than now.
## Profits were anciently a larger share of the produce of manufactures,
## so the proportion of produce required for replacing capital is greater thanit was.
## The proportion between the funds determines whether the inhabitants of the country shall be industrious or idle.
## Increase or diminution of the capital of a country consequently increases or diminishes its annual produces.
## Capitals are increased by parsimoney or saving.
## What is saved is consumed by productive hands.
## The frugal man establishes a perpetual fund for the employment of productive hands.
## The prodigal perverts such funds to other uses.
## Whether he spends on home or foreign commondities makes no difference.
## If he had not spent there would have been just as much money in the country and the goods produced by productive hands as well.
## Besides, when the annual produce dimishes, money will go abroadl
## and on the other hand money will come in when the annual produce incrases.
## So even if the reall wealth of a country consisited of tis money, the prodigal would be a public enemy.
## Injudicious employment of capital has the same effect as prodigality.
## Frugality and prudence predominate.
## Prodigality is more intermittent thatn the desire to better our condition.
## Imprudent undertakings are small in number compared to prudent ones.
## Public prodigality and imprudence are more to be feared than private,
## but are conteracted by private frugality and prudence.
## To increase the produce of a nation an increase of capital is necessary.
## If, therefore the produce has increased, we may be sure the capital has increased.
## This has been the case of almost all nations in peaceable times.
## England for example from 1600 to 1776,
## or from 1558 to 1660.
## though there was much public and private profusion, and many other disorders and misfortunes occurred.
## Private frugality and prudence have silently counteracted these circumstances.
## Apart from increase or diminution of capital different kinds of expense may be distinguished.
## An individual who spends on durable commodities will be richer than on who spends on perishable ones.
## The same thing is true of a nation.
## The former expence is easier to bring to an end,
## and gives maintenance to more people.
## It does not follow that it betokens a more generous spirit.
