# CHAPTER IV: OF STOCK LENT AT INTEREST

## Stock lent at interest is a capital to the lander, but may or may not be so to the borrower.
## Generally it is so to the borrower,
## except in case of mortgages effected by country gentlemen.
## Loans are made in money, but what the borrower wats and gets is goods.
## So the quantity of stock which can be lent is determined by the value of that part of the produce which replaces such capital as the owner does not himself employ.
## This may be much greater than the actual money employed.
## The money is altogether different from what is actually assigned either as principal or interst.
## The stock to be lent at interest natually grows as the whole quantity of stock increases.
## Interest falls as the quantity of stock to be lent increases,
## because profits diminish as it becomes more difficult to find a profitable method of employing new capital.
## The notion that it was the discovery of the West Indies which lowered interest has been refuted by Hume.
## If £100 are now required to purchase what £50 would have purchased then, £10 must now be required to purchase what £5 would have purchased then.
## An increase in the quantity of silver could only diminish is value.
## Nominal wages would be greater, but real wages the same; profits would be the same nominally and really.
## An increase in the goods annually circulated would cause a fall of profits and consequently of interest.
## The prohibition of interest is wrong, and increases the evil of usury.
## Where a maximum rate is fixed, this should be somewhat above the market rate on good security,
## but not much above, or the greater part of loans would be nto prodigals and projectors.
## No law can reduce interest below the market rate.
## The number of years' purchase commonly paid for land depends on the rate of interest.
