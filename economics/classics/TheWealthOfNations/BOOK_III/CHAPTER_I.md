# CHAPTER I: OF THE NATURAL PROGRESS OF OPULENCE

## The greate commerce is that between town and country, which is obviously advantageous to both.
## The cultivation of the country must be prior to the increase of the town,
## tough the town may sometimes be distant from the country from which it derives its subsistence.
## This order of things is favoured by the natural preference of man for agriculture.
## Cultivators require the asstance of artificers, who settle together and form a village, and their employment augments with the improvement of the country.
## In the American colonies and artificer who has acquired sufficient stock becomes a planter instead of manufacturing for distant sale,
## as in countries where no uncultivated land can be procured.
## Manufactures are naturally preferred to foreign commerce.
## So the natural course of things is first agriculture, then manufactures, and finally foreign commerce.
## But his order has been in many respect inverted.
