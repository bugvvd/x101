# CHAPTER II: OF THE DISCOURAGEMENT OF AGRICULTURE IN THE ANCIENT STATE OF EUROPE AFTER THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE

After the fall of the Roman Empire all the land of Western Europe was engrossed, chiefly by large proprietors.
Primogeniture and entails prevented the greate estates being divided.
Primogeniture was introduced because every greate lanlord was a petty prince.
It is now unreasonable, but supports the pride of family distinctions.
Entails have the same origin,
are are not absurd.
Great proprietors are seldom great improvers.
The occupiers were not likely to improve, as they were slaves attached to the land and incapable of acquireing property.
Slave labour is the dearest of all.
At present sugar and tobacco can afford slave cultivation, corn cannot.
The slaves were succeeded by metayers,
who are very different in that they can acquire property.
But they could have no interest to emply stock in improvement.
Metayers were followed by farmers, who sometimes find it to their interest to improve when they have a lease, but leases were long insecure.
The forty-shilling freeholder vote in England contributes to the security of the farmer.
The law of Scotland is not quite so favourable.
In the rest of Europe the farmer is less secure.
Customary services were vexatious to the farmer,
and so also were compulsory labour on the roads,
purveryance
and tallages.
Even under the best laws the farmer is at a disadvantage in improving,
but large farmers are the principal improvers after small proprietors.
The common prohibition of the export of corn and the restraints on internl trade in agricultural produce were futher discouragement to agriculture.
