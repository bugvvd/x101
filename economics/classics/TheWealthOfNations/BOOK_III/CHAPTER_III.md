# CHAPTER III: OF THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF CITIES AND TOWNS AFTER THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE

## The toensmen were not at first favoured more than the countrymen.
## They were very nearly of servile condition,
## but arrived at liberty much earlier than the country people, acquireing the farm of their town,
## first for a term of years and afterwards in perpetuiry,
## as well as other priileges equivalent to freedom,
## and a government of their own.
## It seems strange that sovereigns should have abandoned the prospect of increased revenue and have erected independent republics,
## but the towns were the natural allies of the sovereign against the lords.
## The sovereigns who quarrelled most with the barons were the most liberal to the towns.
## The city militia was often able to overpower the neighbouring lords, as in Italy and Switzerland.
## In France and England the cities could not be taxed without their own consent.
## In consequence of this greater security of the towns industry flourished and stock accumulated there earlier than in the country.
## Cities on the seacoast or on navigable rivers are not dependent on the neighbouring country.
## The cities of Italy were the first to grow opulent, being centrally situated and benefited by the crusades.
## The cities imported manufactures and luxuries from richer countries, which were paid for by rude produce.
## Demand for such manufactured articles having become considerable, their manufacture was established in the cities.
## All countries have some manufactures.
## Sometimes manufactures for distant sale are introduced in imitation of foreign manufactures.
## Sometimes they have grown up out of the coarser home manufactures.
