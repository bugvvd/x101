# CHAPTER IV: OF THE ORIGIN AND USE OF OF MONEY

The mercantile system discourages the exportation of materials of manufacture and instruments of trade.
It encourages the importation of materials though not of instruments of trade.
and (3) because order and good government were introduced.
Before foreign commerce and fine manufactures are introduced greate proprietors are surrounded by bands of retainers,
and tenants at will were just as dependent as retainers.
The power of the ancient barons was founded on this.
It was anterior to and independent of the feudal law.
It was moderated by the feudal law,
and undermined by foreign commerce.
At present a rich man maintain sin all as many persons as an ancient baron, but he contributes only a small portion of the maintenance of each person.
To meet their new expenses the greate proprietors dismissed their retainers and their unnecessary tenants, and gave the remaining tenants long leases,
this making them independent.
The grate proprietors thus become insignificant.
Old families are rare in commercial countries.
A revolution was thyus insensibly brought about,
and commerce and manufactures became the cause of the improvement of the country. This order of things is both slow and uncertain compared with the natual order, as may be shown by the rapid progress of the North American colonies,
and the slow progress of England in agriculture in spite of favours accorded to it
and the still slower progress of France,
Spain and Portugal.
Italy alone was improved throughout by foreign commerce and exported manufactures.
The national capital acquired by commerce and manufacture is an uncertain possesion till realised in the improvement of land.
