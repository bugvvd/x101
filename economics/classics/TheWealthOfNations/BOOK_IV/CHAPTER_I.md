# CHAPTER I: OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE COMMERCIAL OR MERCANTILE SYSTEM

## Wealth and money in common language are considered synonymous.
## Similarly the Tartars thought wealth consisted of cattle.
## Locke thought gold and silver the most substantial part of the walth of a nation.
## Others say that it is necessary to have much money in order to maintain fleets and armies abroad.
## So all European nations have tried to accumulte gold and silver.
## At first by a prohibition of exploration,
## but merchants found this inconvenient,
## and therfore argued that exportation did not always diminish the stock in the country,
## and that the metals could be retained only by attention to the balance of trade.
## Their arguments were partly sophistical,
## but they convinced parliaments and concils.
## The exportation of foreign coin and bullion was permitted by France and Engliand, and the exportation of Duch coin by Holland.
## That treasure was obtained by foreign trade became a received maxim.
## Gold and silver will be imported without any attention of government.
## They can be imported more easily than other commodities when there is an effectual demand.
## When their quantity exceeds the demand it is impossible to prevent their exportation,
## and it would be equially impossible to prevent their importation if the supply fell short of the effectual edemand.
## It is this ease of transportation which makes the value of gold and silver so uniform.
## If the did fall short, their place could be supplied by paper.
## The common complaint of scarcity of money only means difficulty in borrowning.
## Money makes but a small part of the national capital.
## It is easier to buy than to sell simply because money is the instrument of commerce.
## The durability of a commondity is no reason for accumulating more of it than is wanted.
## Accumulation of gold and silver is not necessary for carrying distant wars,
## which may be paid for by exporting: (1) gold and silver, (2) manufactures, or (3) rude produce.
## The gold and silver consists of money in circulation, plate, and money in the treasury.
## Little can be spared from the money in circulation;
## olate has never yield much;
## accuulation in the treasury has been abandoned.
## The foreign wars of the century have evidently not been paid from the money in circulation
## but by commodities.
## Part of the bullion which circulates from country to country may have been employed, but it must have been purchased with commondities.
## The finer manufactures are the most convenient commodities for the purpose.
## Rude produce is inconvenient.
## The principal bebefit of foreign trade is not the importation of gold and silver, but the carrying out of surplus produce for which there is no demand and bringing back something for which there is.
## The discovery of America has benefited Europe not by the cheapening of gold and silver,
## but by openin gup a new market which improved the productive powers of labour.
## The discovery of the sea passage to the East Indies would have been still more advantageous if the trade to the ## East Indies had been free.
## The exportation of silver to the East Indies is not harmful.
## Writers who begin by including lands, houses and consumable goods in wealth often forget them later.
## Wealth being supposed to consist in gold and silver, political economy endeavoured to diminish imports and encourage exports,
## by restraints upon importation
## and encouragements to exportation,
## which restraints and encouragements will be considered in the next six chapters.
