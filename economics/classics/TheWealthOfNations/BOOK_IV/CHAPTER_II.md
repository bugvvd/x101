# CHAPTER II: OF RESTRAINTS UPON THE IMPORTATION FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES OF SUCH GOODS AS CAN BE PRODUCED AT HOME

## High duties and prohibitions giving a monopoly to a particular home industry are very common.
## They encourage the particular industry, but neither increase general industry nor give it the best direction.
## The number of persons employed cannot exceed a certain proportion to the capital of the society,
## and every man's interest leads him to seek that employment of capital which is most advantageous to the society.
## (1) He tries to employ it as near home as possible.
## (2) He endeavours to produce the greatest possible value.
## He can judge of this much better than the statesman.
## High duties and prohibitions direct people to employ capital in producting at home what they could by cheaper from abroad.
## It is as foolish for a nation as for an individual to make what can be bought cheaper.
## Sometimes by such regulations a manufacture may be established earlier thant it would ptherwise have been but this would make capital accumulate slower,
## and the country might always be just as rich if it never acquire the manufacture.
## No one proposes that a country should strive against greate natural advantages, but it is also absurd to strive against smaller advantages whether natural or acquired.
## Merchants and manufacturers get the most benefit from high duties and prohibitions.
## The free importation of foreign cattle would make no greate difference to British graziers.
## It might even benefit the cultivated plains at the expense of the rugged mountainous district.
## The free importation of salt provisions also would make little difference to the graziers,
## and even the free importaion of corn would not much affect the farmers.
## Country gentlemen and farmers are less subject to the spirit of monopoly than merchants and manufacturers.
## The prohibition of foreign corn and cattle restrains the population.
## There are two cases which are exceptional, (1) when a particular industry is necessary for the defence of the country, like shipping, which is properly encouraged by the act of navigation,
## a wise act, though dictated by animosity,
## and unfavourable to foreign commerce;
## and (2) when there is a tax on the produce of the like home manufacture.
## Some people say that this principle justifies a general imposition of duties on imports to counter-balance taxes levied at home on necessaries,
## but there is a difference,
## since (1) the effect of taxes on necessaries cannot be exactly known,
## and (b) taxes on necessaries are like poor soil or bad climate: they cannot justify and attempt to give capital an unnatural direction.
## Taxes on necessaries are commonest in the richest countries because no others could support them.
## There are two other possible exceptions to the general principle:
## (1) Retaliation
## may be good policy where it is likely to secure the abolition of foreign restraints.
## (2) It my be desirable to introduce freedom of trade by slow gradations.
## But the disorder occasioned by its sudden introduction would be less thant is supposed since
## (a) no manufacture which is now exported would be affected;
## (b) the people thrown out of the employment would easily find another,
## especially if the privileges of coporations and the law of settlement were abolished.
## Private interests are too strong to allow of the restoration of freedom of trade in Great Britain.
## The fact that equitable regard is due to the manufacturer who has fixed capital in his business is an argument against the establishment of new monopolies.
## Customs duties imposed for revenue remain to be considered hereafter.
