# CHAPTER III: OF THE EXTRAORDINARY RESTRAINTS UPON THE IMPORATION OF GOODS OF ALMOST ALL KINDS, FROM THOSE COUNTRIES WITH THICH THE BALANCE IS SUPPOSED TO BA DISADVANTAGEOUS

## PART I: OF THE UNREASONABLENESS OF THOSE RESTRAINTS EVEN UPON THE PRINCIPLES OF THE COMMERCIAL SYSTEM
## British restraints on imports from France are an example.
## Such restraints are unreasonable on the principles of the mercantile system, since
## (1) if free trade with France did lead to an unfavourable balance with France, it might yet not do so with the world in general
## (2) a part of French imports might be reexported and bring back gold and silver;
## and (3) the balance cannot be certainly known;
## custom-house books are useless, and the course of exchange is litter better.
## A favourable exchange with a particular country does not prove a faourable balance with that country.
## Besides, the ordinary computation of exchange is often misleading, since
## (1) money is often below its nominal standard,
## (2) coin is sometimes raised by seignorage above the value of the bullion contained in it,
## and (3) bank money bears an agio.
## DIGRESSION CONCERNING BANKS OF DEPOSIT, PARTICULARLY CONCERNING THAT OF AMSTERDAM
## PART II: OF THE UNREASONABLENESS OF THOSE EXTRAORDINARY RESTRAINTS UPON OTHER PRINCIPLES
## The whole doctrine of the balance of trade is absurd.
## Where there is an even balance and the exchagne consists wholly of native commodities two countries trading will gain nearly equally.
## If one exported nothing but native commodities, and the other nothing but foreign, both would gain, but the first would gain most.
## Mixed cases conform to the principle.
## It would be no worse for England to pay in gold and silver than in tobacco.
## The arguments against the French wine trade are fallacious.
## The sneaking arts of underling tradesmen have been erected into political maxim and commerce has become a source of discord instead of unity.
## The sophistry of merchants inspired by the spirit of monopoly has confounded the common-sense of mankind.
## Wealthy neighbours are an advantage to a nation as well as an individual.
## The French trade, if not restrained, would be much more advantageous to Great Britian than the American.
## But the traders of France and England are jealous of each other.
## No country has ever been impoverished by an unfavourable balance, and those which have the freest trade have been the most enriched by foreign trade.
## Prosperity and decay depend on the balance of produce and consumption,
## which is quite different from the balance of trade,
## and may be constantly in favour of a nation when the balance of trade is against it.
