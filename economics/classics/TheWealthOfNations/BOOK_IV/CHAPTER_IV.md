# CHAPTER IV: OF DRAWBACKS

## Merchants demand encouragements to exportation.
## Drawbacks of duty paid on domestic produce are reasonable, as they preserve the natural distribution of labour.
## So are also drawbacks of duty paid on goods imported.
## Under the old subsidy a drawback of one-half is allowed.
## Of more recent duties the whole is generally allowed,
## and in some cases the whole even of the old subsidy is allowed.
## In the case of some prohibited goods there is no drawback.
## French imports generally are allowed a smaller drawback on reexportation.
## Wines have been peculiarly favoured,
## especially when exported to the American colonies,
## though the export of other foreign commodities to those coonies was discouraged.
## Drawbacks were originally granted carrying trade, which was absurd, but they are reasonable enough.
## The revenue gains by their existence when they do not amount to the whole of the duty paid.
## They would be justified even if they always did amount to the whole duty paid
## but only to independent countries, not to those in respect of which there is a monopoly of trade.
