# OF THE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS, OR OF THOSE SYSTEMS OF POLITICAL ECONOMY, WHICH REPRESENT THE PRODUCE OF LAND AS EITHER THE SOLE OR THE PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF THE REVENUE AND WEALTH OF EVERY COUNTRY

## The agricultural system will require less lengthy explanation than the mercantile syste.
## Colber adopted the mercantile system and favoured town industry,
## with the result that the French philosophers who support the agricultural system indervalue town industry.
## There are three classes in their system: (1) proprietors, (2) cultivators, and (3) artificers, manufacturers and merchants.
## Proprietors contribute to production by expenses on improvement of land,
## cultivators, by original and annual expenses of cultivation.
## These expnses sould be free from all taxation.
## All other expenses and orders of people are unproductive,
## artificers and manufacturers in particular, and the expense of employing them:
## merchantile stock also.
## The labour of artificers and manufacturers adds nothing to the value of the annual produce.
## Artificers, manufacturers and merchants can augment revenue only by privation.
## The unproductive class is maintained at the expense of other two,
## but is useful to them,
## and it is not their interest to discourage its industry;
## nor is it ever the interest of the unproductive class to oppress the others.
## Mercantile states similarly are maintained at the expense of landed states,
## but are greatly useful to them,
## and it is not the interest of landed nations to discourage their industry by high duties.
## Freedom of trade would in due time supply artificers etc., at home,
## in consequence of the increase of their capital, which would first emply manufacturers,
## and afterwards overflow into foreign trade.
## Freedom of trade therefore is best for introducting manufactures and foreign trade.
## High duties and prohibitions sink the value of agricultural product, raise mercantile and manufacturing profit,
## and could only raise up manufacturers and merchants prematurely.
## The distribution of the produce of land is represented in the Economical Table.
## Nations can prosper in spite of hurtful regulations.
## The system is wrong in representing artificers, etc., as unproductive, since,
## (1) they reproduce at least their annual consumption and continue the capitalwhich employes them,
## (2) they are not like menial servants,
## (3) their labour increases the real revenue of the society,
## (4) for augmenting anual produce parsimoney is just as much required from farmers as from them,
## and (5) trade and manufactures can procure that subsistence which the system regards as the only revenue.
## In spite of its errors the system has been valuable.
## Some nations have favoured agriculture.
## China, for example,
## China is itself of very greate extent, but more foreign trade would be advantageous to it.
## Egypt and the Gentoo government of Indostan favoured agriculture.
## The people were divided into castes in these countries.
## Irrigation was attended to there.
## Egypt and India were dependent on other nations for foreign trade.
## The land tax gave estern soverigns a particular interest in agriculture.
## Ancient Greece and Rome discouraged manufactures and foreign trade, and carried on manufactures only by slave labour, which is expensive.
## Everything which raises the price of manufactures discourages agriculture,
## and this is done by systems which restrain manufactures and foreign trade.
## So all systems of encouragements and restraints retard the progress of society.
## The system of natural liberty leaves the soverign only three duties: (1) the defence of the country; (2) the administration of justice, and (3) the maintenance of certain public works.
## The next book will treat of necessary expenses of the soverign, the methods of contribution towards the expenses of the whole society, and the causes and effects of public
