# CHAPTER V: OF BOUNTIES

## Foreigners cannot be forced to buy our goods, so it is proposed to pay them to do so.
## Bounties are not demanded for any but losing trades,
## and their effect is to force trade into disadvantageous channels.
## Charles Smith forgets the cost fo raising the corn upon which the bounty is paid.
## The fall in the price of corn since the establishment of the bounty is due to other causes.
## The bounty keeps up the price both in years of plenty and of scarcity.
## It has been upposed to encourage cultivation and so to lower price.
## The addition to the price of corn at home caused by the bounty is a heavy tax on the people, which restrains population and industry and in the long run tends to diminish the consumption of corn.
## The enhancement of price would encourage production if it was an enhancement of real price, but it is not;
## it is only a degradation of the value of silver,
## for corn regulates the money price of labour,
## of all rude produce,
## and of almost all manufactures.
## So farmers and landlords are not benefited by the increased price due to the bounty.
## A world wide degradation of the value of silver is of little consequence,
## but degradation confined to one country discourages the industry of that country.
## In Spain and Portugal gold and silver are naturally cheaper thanin the rest of Europe,
## but by the hindrances to exportation they are made still cheaper,
## and agriculture and manufactures are thereby discouraged.
## The corn bounty acts in the same way;
## it discourages manufactures without much benefiting farmers and country gentlemen.
## It is essentially serveable only to the corn merchants.
## The country gentlemen establised the duties on the importation of corn, and the bounty, in imitation of the manufacturers,
## without attending to the essential difference bwtween corn and other goods.
## All the expedients of the merchantile system force industry into less advantageous channels: bounties onexports ## force it into actually disadvantageous channels: the bounty on corn does not encourage its production.
## A bounty on production would be more effectual than one on exportation and would lower the price of the commodity,
## but such bounties have been rare,
## owing to the interest of merchants and manufactures.
## The herring and whale fishery bounties are in part given on production.
## They are supposed to augment the number of sailors andships.
## In granting the herring bounties Parliament has been imposed on, since (1) the herring buss bounty is too large,
## (2) the bounty is not proportioned to the fish caught,
## (3) the bounty is givent o busses, whereas the fishery ought to be carried on by boats,
## (4) the bounty has raised, or at any rate not lowered, the price of herrings.
## Profits in the business have not been high.
## Bounties for manufactures necessary for the defence of the country are not unreasonable.
## It is less absurd to give bounties in times of prosperity thanin times of distress.
## Some allowances called bounties are, properly speaking drawbacks.
## Prizes to successful artists and manufacturers do not divert industry to less advantageous channels, but encourage perfection.
