# CHAPTER VI: OF TREATIES OF COMMERCE

## Treaties of commerce are advantageous to the favoured,
## but disadvantageous to the favouring country.
## Treaties have been concluded with the object of obtaining a favourable lalance of trade,
## e.g., the Methuen treaty,
## which is evidently advantageous to Portugal and disadvantageouts to Great Britain.
## Porgugal sends much gold to England;
## at one time nearly the whole of this gold was said to be on account of other European nations,
## but even if it were not so, the trade would not be more valuable than another of equal magnitude,
## Most of the gold must be sent abroad again and exchanged for goods, and it would be better to buy the goods direct with home produce instead of buying gold in Portugal.
## Britain would find little difficulty in procuring gold even if excluded from trade with Portugal.
## It is said that all our gold comes from Portugal, but if it did not come from Portugal it would come from other countries.
## If the attempt of France and Spain to exclude British ships from Portuguese ports had been successful, it would have been an advantage to England.
## The great importation of gold and silver is for foreign trade.
## Very little is required for plate and coin.
## New gold plate is motly made from old.
## New coin is mostly made from old, as there is a profit on melting good coin.
## A seignorage raises the value of coin above that of bullion of equal weight,
## as in France.
## It diminishes or destroys the profit obtained by melting coin.
## The abolition of seignorage in England was probably due to the bank of England,
## but the bank would have lost nothing by a seignorage whether it equalled the depreciation,
## exceeded it,
## or fell short of it.
## Nor would it lose if there were no depreciation.
## A seignorage is paid by no one,
## and could not have augmented the expense of the bank.
## The governent loses and nobody gains by the absence of seignorage.
## Supposing the coin should again become depreciated, a seignorage would preserve the bank from considerable loss.
## The saving to the government may be regarded as too trifiling, but that of the bank is worth considerable.
