# CHAPTER VII: OF COLONIES

## PART FIRST: OF THE MOTIVES FOR ESTABLISHING NEW COLONIES
## Greek colonies were sent out when the population grew too great at home.
## The mother city claimed no authority.
## Roman colonies were sent out to staisfy the demand for lands and to establish garrisons in conquered territories;
## they were entirely subject to the mother city.
## the utility of the American colonies is not so evident.
## The Venetians had a profitable trade in East India goods,
## which was envied by the Portuguese and led them to discover the Cape of Good Hope passage.
## while Columbus endeavoured to reach the East Indies by sailing westwards.
## Columbus mistook the countries he found for the Indies.
## Hence the names East and West Indies.
## The countries discovered were not rich
## in animals
## or vegetables,
## cotton being not then considered of great consequence.
## The Council of Castile was attracted by the gold, Columbus proposing that the government should have half the gold and silver discovered.
## This was an impossible tax and was soon reduced.
## The subsequent Spanish enterprises were all prompted by the same motive.
## A prudent law-giver would not wish to encourage gold and silver mining,
## but people have always believed in an Eldorado.
## In this case expectations were to some extent realised, so fas as the Spaniards were concerned,
## but the other nations were not so successful.
## PART SECOND: CAUSES OF THE PROSPERITY OF NEW COLONIES
## Colonists take out knowledge and regular government,
## land is plentiful and cheap,
## wages are high,
## and children are taken care of and are profitable.
## Population and improvement, which mean wealth and greatness, are encouraged.
## The progress of the Greek colonies was very rapid.
## That of the Roman colonies much less so.
## The American colonies have had plenty of land and not very much interference from their mother countries.
## The progress of the Spanish colonies, Mexico and Peru, has been very considerable.
## The Portuguese coony of Brazil is very populous.
## When Spain declied, various countries obtained a footing in America.
## The Swedish colony of New Jersey was prospering when swallowed up by New York.
## The Danish colonies of St. Thomas and Santa Cruz have been very prosperous since the exclusive company was dissolved.
## The Dutch colony of Surinam is prosperous though still under an exclusive company.
## The French colony of Canada has shown rapid progress since the dissolution of the exclusive company.
## St. Domingo, in spite of various obstacle, and the other French sugar colonies, are very thriving.
## But the progress of the English colonies has been the most rapid.
## They have not so much good land as the Spanish and Portuguese, but there institutions are more favourable to its improvement.
## (1) The engrossing of uncultivated land has been more restrained.
## (2) Primogeniture and entails are less prevalent and alienation more frequent.
## (3) Taxes are more moderate.
## (4) The trade monopoly of the mother country has been less oppressive,
## since there has been no exclusive company with its interest to buy the produce of the colonies as cheap as possible,
## nor any restriction of commerce to a particular port and to particular licensed ships,
## but freedom for every subject to trade with every port in the mother country,
## and freedom to export every thing but the enumerated commodities to other places besides the mother country.
## Some most important productions are not enumerated,
## as grain,
## timber,
## cattle,
## fish,
## sugar,
## and rum.
## Grain, meat and fish would have competed too strongly with British produce if forced into the Britih market.
## Originally non-enumerated commodities could be exported to any part of the world. Recently they have been confined to countries south of Cape Finisterre.
## The enumerated commodities are (1) commodities not produced at all in the motehr country, and (2) commodities of which only a small part of the supply is produced in the mother country.
## On the importation of naval stores to Great Britain a bounty was give.
## American pig iron is exempt from duty.
## These regulations have raised the value of timber and thus helped to clear the country.
## Freedom of trade prevails between the British American colonies and the British West Indies.
## British liberality does not extend to refined manufactures.
## Manufactured sugar is subject to heavy duty.
## Steel furnances and slit-mills may not be erected in the colonies.
## Hats, wools and woollen good produced in America may not be carried in bulk from province to province.
## Such prohibitions though a violation of sacred rights, have not as yet been very hurtful.
## The importation into Great Britain of various colonial production is encouraged wither by abatement of duties or by bounties.
## In regard to imports from Europe the British colonies have had more liberal treatment than those of other countries,
## drawbacks being allow,
## owing to the advice of interested metchants.
## Except in reguard to foreign trade the English colonies have complete liberty.
## The absolute grovenments of Spain, of Portugual, and in a less degree of France, are even more violent in colonies than at home.
## The sugar colonies of France are more prosperous than the English because they are not discouraged from refining, and slaves are better managed,
## absolute government being more favourable to the slaves than republican,
## as may be seen inRoman history.
## The superiority of the French sugar colonies is the more remarkable inasmuch as they have accumulated their own stock.
## The policy of Europe has done nothing for the prosperity of the colonies.
## Folly and injustice directed the first project.
## The more respectable adventurers of later times were sent out by the disorder and injustice of European govenments.
## To the actual establishment of the colonies the governments of Europe contributed little,
## and discouraged rather than encouratged them after they were established.
## Europe has done nothing except provide the men who founded the colonies.
## PART THIRD: OF THE ADVANTAGES WHICH EUROPE HAS DERIVED FROM THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA, AND FROM THAT OF A PASSAGE TO THE EAST INDIES BY THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE
## The advantages derived by Europe from America are (1) the advantages of Europe in general, and (2) the advantages of the paricular countries which have colonies.
## (1) The general advantages to Europe are,
## (a) an increase of enjoyment,
## (b) an augmentation of industry not only in the countries which trade with America directly, but also in other countries which do not send their produce to America,
## or even receive any produce from America.
## The exclusive trade of the mother countries reduces the enjoyments and industry of all Europe and America, especially the latter.
## (2) The particular advantages of the colonising countries are (a) the common advantages deried from provinces, (b) the peculiar advantages derived from provinces in America:
## (a) the common advantages are contributions of military forces and revenue,
## but none of the colonies have ever funished military force,
## and the colonies of Spain and Portugal alone have contributed revenue.
## (b) the exclusive trade is the sole peculiar advantage.
## The exclusive trade of each country is a disadvantage to the other countries,
## rather than an advantage to that country,
## e.g., England gets tobacco cheaper than France, but not cheaper than it would if there were no exclusive trade.
## To subject other countries to this disadvantage England has made two scrifices.
## The withdrawal of foreign capital from the colony trade raised profits in ti and drew capital from other British trades and thereby raised profits in them,
## and continue to do so.
## The colony trade has increased faster than the whole British capital,
## and the colonial monopoly has merely changed the direction of British trade.
## The monopoly has kept the rate of profit in British trade higher than it naturally would have beem,
## and this puts the country at a disadvantage in the trades of which she has no monopoly,
## making her buy less and sell less,
## and enabling other countries to undersell her in foreign markets.
## High profits raise the price of manufactures more than high wages.
## So British capital has been taken from European and Mediterranean trade,
## partly attracted by high profit in the colony trade,
## partly driven out by foreign compeition.
## While raising British profit, the monopoly has lowered foreign profits.
## The colony trade is supposed to be more advantageous thanothers,
## but trade with a neighbouring country is more advantageous than with a distant one, and a direct trade is more advantageous than a round-about,
## while the monopoly has forced captal int (1) a distant and (2) a round-about trade.
## (1) The trade with America and the West Indies is distant and the returns peculiarly infrequent.
## (2) It is also largely a round-about trade
## The monopoly has also forced part of the capital of Great Britain into a carrying trade,
## and makes here whole industry and commerce less secure owing to its being driven into one channel.
## The gradual relaxation of the monopoly is desirable.
## The present exclusion from the trade with the twelve provinces would have been more severly felt but for five transitory cirsumstances.
## The monopoly is bad,
## but the trade itself is good.
## The trade in its natual state increases the productive labour of Great Britian.
## The monopoly diminishes it.
## The natual good effects of the trade more than counterbalance the bad effects of the monopoly.
## The colonies offer a market for the manufactured rather than the rude produce of Europe, 
## but the monopoly has not maintained the manufacture of Spain and Portugal,
## where the bad effects of the monopoly have nearly overbalanced the good effects of the trade.
## In England the good effects of the trade have greatly counteracted the bad effects of the monopoly.
## The trade has benefited British manufactures in spite of the monoipoly, not in consequence of it.
## The monopoly reduces wages in the mother country,
## raises profits,  and thereby tends to lower rents and the price of land.
## It reduces the absolute amount of profit,
## thus rendering all the original sources of revenue less abundant.
## More fatal still it destroys parsimony.
## The policy of the monopoly is a policy of shopkeepers.
## The expenditure of Great Britain on the colonies has all been laid out to support the monopoly, and is enormous.
## A voluntary separation would be very advantageous.
## The colonies do not furnish nearly sufficient revenue to make them advantageous.
## The colonial assemblies will never vote enough,
## and have no knowledge of what is required.
## It has been proposed that parliament should tax the colonies by requisition,
## as the King of France taxes some of his provinces,
## but parliament has not sufficient authority,
## and resistance breaks out.
## Representation in parliament in proportion to taxation should be offered.
## Otherwise it seems hopeless to expect submission,
## and resistance will be as obstinate as that of Paris.
## The discovery of representation makes the case different from that of Rome and Italy.
## The American representatives could be managed.
## The Americans would not be oppressed.
## The discovery of America and the Cape passage are the greatest events in history: the misfortunes of the natives of the East and West Indies may be temporary, so the results may be beneficial to all.
## Meantime the discovery has exaleted the mercantile system.
## The countries which possess America and trade to the East Indies appear to get all the advantage, but this is not the case.
## The monopoly regulations sometimes harm the country which establishes them more than others.
## The mother countries have engrossed only the expense and inconveniencies of possessiong colonies.
## The monopoly of American trade is adazzling object.
## The stock of a country naturally seeks the employment most advantageous to the country,
## preferring the near to the more distant employments,
## unless profits are higher in the more distant, which indicates that the more distant employment is necessary.
## If too much goes to any employment, profit falls in that employment and the proper distribution is soom restored.
## The mercantile system disturbs this distribution, especially in regard to American and Indian trade.
## The portuguese attempted at first to exclude all other nations from trading in the Indian Seas, and the Dutch still exclude all other nations from trade with the Spice Islands.
## Now the principal ports are open, but each country has establised an exclusive company.
## Monopolies of the American kind always attract, but monopolies of exclusive companies sometimes attract, sometimes repel stock.
## In poor countries they attract,
## in rich they repel.
## Both effects are hurtful.
## A country which cannot trade to the East Indies without an exclusive company should not trade there.
## The idea that the large capital of a company is necessary is fallacious.
## There are notnumerous and thriving colonies in Africa and the East Indies, as in America.
## The Dutch exclusive company destroyes spices and nutmeg trees,
## and has reduced the population of the Moluccas.
## The English company has the same tendency.
## This destructive system is contrary to their interest as sovereigns,
## but they prefer the transitory profits of the monopolist merchant to the permanent revenue of the sovereign.
## The administration in India thinks only of buying cheap and selling dear,
## its members trade on their own account and cannot be prevented from doing so,
## and this private trade is more extensive and harmful than the public trade of the company.
## The interest of the servants is not, like the real interest of the company, the same as that of the country.
## The evils come from the system, not from the character of the men who administer it.
