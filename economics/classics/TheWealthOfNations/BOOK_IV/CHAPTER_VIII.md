# CHAPTER VIII: CONCLUSION OF THE MERCANTILE SYSTEM

## The mercantile system discourages the exportation of materials of manufacture and instruments of trade.
## It encourages the importation of materials though not of instruments of trade.
## Various materials are exempt from customs duties.
## Yarn, though a manufactured article, is free from duty,
## because the spinners are poor, unprotected people, and the master weavers are rich and powerful.
## This exemption and also the bounty on the exportation of linen are given by a temporary law.
## Bounties on imported materials have been chiefly given to American produce, such as naval stores,
## colonial indigo,
## colonial hemp or undressed flax,
## American wood,
## colonial raw silk,
## colonial barrel staves,
## Irish hemp.
## These commodities were subject to duties when coming from foreign countries. It was alleged that the interest of colonies and of the mother country was the same.
## The exportation of wool and live sheep is forbidden under heavy penalties,
## at one time mutilation and death,
## but now twenty shillings for every sheep with forfeiture of the sheep and the owner's share in the ship,
## and three shillings for every pound of wool, with other pains and penalities.
## To prevent clandestine exportation the inland commerce of wool is much hampered by restriction,
## especially in Kent and Sussex,
## and so also is the coasting trade.
## The manufacturers alleged that English wool was superior to all others, which is entirely false.
## These regulations have depressed the price of wool, as was desired,
## but this has not much reduced the quantity of wool grown,
## nor its quality,
## so that the growers of wool have been less hurt than might hav been expected.
## Though prohibition of exportation cannot be justified, a duty on the exportation of wool might furnish revenue with little inconvenience.
## The exportation of fuller's earth has been subjected to the same penalties as the exportation of wool.
## The exportation of raw highes is forbidden,
## horns,
## wollen yarn and worsted, white cloths, watch cases, etc., also
## some metals.
## On various other materials of manufacture considerable export duties are imposed.
## Gum senega has a peculiar history and is subject to a large export duty,
## beaver skins exported are charged seven pence,
## and coals five shillings a ton.
## The exportation of the instruments of trade is commonly prohibited.
## Similarly it is a grave offence to entice and artificer abroad,
## and the artificer who exercises of teaches his trade abroad may be ordered to return.
## The object is to depress the manufactures of our neighbours.
## The mercantile system absurdly considers production and not consumption to be the end of industry and comerce.
## Restraints on importation of competing commoditieis sacrifice the interest of the consumer to the producer,
## and so do bounties on exportation and the provision of the Methuen treaty,
## but the most extravagant case of all is that of the management of the American and West Indian colonies.
## The contrivers of the whole mercantile system are the producers and especially the merchants and manufacturers.
