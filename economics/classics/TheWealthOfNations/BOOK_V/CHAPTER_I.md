# CHAPTER I: THE EXPERENCES OF THE SOVEREIGN OR COMMONWEALTH

## PART I: OF THE EXPENCE OF DEFENCE
## The expense of a military force is differenct at different period.
## Among hunters it consts nothing.
## When shepherds go to war the whole nation moves with its property
## and the sovereign is at no expense.
## Shepherds are far more formidable than hunters.
## Hushandmen with little commerce and only household manufactures are sasily converted into soldiers, and it seldom costs the sovereign aything to prepare them for the field,
## or to maintain them when they have taken the field.
## Later it becomes necessary to pay those who take the field,
## since artificers and manufacturers must be maintained by the public when away from their work,
## and the grater length of campaigns make service without pay too heavy a burden wven for husbandmen.
## The possible proportion of soldiers to the rest of they population is much smaller in civilised times.
## The expense of preparing for the field was long inconsiderable.
## Soldiers were not a distince class in Greece and Rome, nor at first in feudal time.
## But as war becomes more complicated, division of labour becomes necessary to carry the are to perfection.
## As society advances the people become unwarlike.
## There are only two method for providing for defence, (1) to enforce military exercises and service, or (2) to make the trade of the soldier a separate one: in other words the establishment of a militia or a standing army.
## Militias were anciently only exercised and not regimented.
## Fire-arms brought about the change by making dexterity less important, and discipline much more so.
## A militia is always inferior to a standing army, being less expert,
## and less well diciplined.
## The best militias are those which go to war under the chieftains who role in time of peace.
## A militia kept long enough in the field becomes a standing army.
## History shows the superiority of the standing army.
## That of Macedon defeated the Greek militias.
## In the wars of Carthage and Rome standing armies defeated militias.
## The Carthaginan standing army defeated the Roman militia in Italy,
## and Spain.
## When the Roman militias became a standing army they defeated the Carthaginian standing army in Italy
## and the Carthaginian militia in Spain, and both standing army and militia in Africa.
## Thenceforward the Roman republic had standing armies, which found little resistance except from the standing army Macedon.
## Under the emperior these armies degenerated into militias.
## Militias were gradually superseded by standing armies in Western Europe.
## A standing army does not lose its valour in time of peace,
## and is the only safeguard of a civilised nation,
## also the only means of civilising a barbarous one.
## It is not unfavrouable to liberty.
## Defence thus grows more expensive.
## Fire-armes enhance the expense,
## and so give an advantage to rich nations, which is favourable to civilisation.
## PART II: OF THE EXPENSE OF JUSTICE
## The expense of justice is different at different periods.
## Civil government was first rendered necessary by the introduction of property.
## Property strengthens the causes of subordination.
## There are four causes of subordination,
## (1) superiority of personal qualifications,
## (2) superiority of age,
## (3) superiority of fortune,
## and (4) superiority of birth.
## The distincetion of birth is no present among hunters,
## but always among sheperds.
## Distinctions of birth and fortune are both most powerful among shepherds.
## Among sheperds inequiality of fortune arises and introduces civil government,
## but the judicial authority was long a source of revenue rather than expense,
## which produced greate abuses,
## whether the sovereign exercised the judicial authority in person or by deputy.
## These abuses could not be remedied so long as the sovereign depended only on land revenue and court fees,
## but when taxes became necessary, the people stipulated that no presents should be taken by judges.
## Justice is never administered gratis.
## The salaries of judges are a small part of the expense of civilised government,
## and might be defrayed by fees of court.
## The English courts were originally maintained by fees, and this led to their encroachments.
## Courts might be maintained by a stamp duty on proceedings before them, but his wouldtempt them to multiply such proceeding.
## Another way of securing independence would be to endow the courts with a revenue from property.
## The seperation of the judicial from the executive pwoer is due to the increase of executive business.
## The judicial should be only separated but independent of the executive power.
## PART III: OF THE EXPENCE OF PUBLIC WORKS AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS
## The third duty of the sovereign is the erection and maintenane of those public works and institutions which are useful but not capable of brining in a profit to individuals.
## These are chiefly institutions for facilitating commerce and promoting instruction.
## ARTICLE I: OF THE PUBLIC WORKS AND INSTITUTIONS FOR FACILITATING THE COMMERCE OF THE SOCEITY AND, FIRST, OF THOSE WHICH ARE NECESSARY FOR FACILITATING COMMERCE IN GENERAL
## The expence of such institions increases.
## The expense need not be defrayed from the general public revenue,
## but may be raised by tolls and other particular charges.
## Tolls according to weight of carriages and capacity of boats are very equitable.
## If the tolls are higher on carriages of luxury, the rich contribute in an easy manner to the relief of the poor.
## Roads and canals, etc., thus paid for cannot be made except where they are wanted.
## Canals are better in the hands of private persons than of commissioners.
## But tolls on a high road cannot safely be made private property and must be committed to trustees.
## The prevalence of complaints against Brigish turnpike tolls is not remarkable.
## It has been proposed that the government should manage the turnpikes and make a revenue from them.
## This plan is open to the following objections,
## (1) the tolls would be raised and become a greate encubrance to commerce,
## (2) a tax on carriages in proportion to weight falls principally on the poor,
## and (3) the roads would be neglected.
## High roads are under the executive in France,
## and great post roads are generally good, but all the rest entirely neglected.
## The executive in China and other parts of Asia maintains both hight roads and canals, it is said, in good  condition, but this would not be the case in Europe.
## Public works of a local nature should be maintained by local revenue.
## The abuses of local administration are small compared with those of administration of the general revenue.
## SOME PUBLIC WORKS AND INSTITUTIONS WHICH ARE NECESSARY FOR FACILITATING PARTICULAR BRANCHES OF COMMERCE
## Some particular institutions are required to facilitate particular branches of commerce, as trade with barbarous nations requires forts, and trade with other nations requires ambassadors.
## Branches of commerce which require extraordinary expense for their protection may resonablyy bear a particular tax.
## The proceeds of such taxes should be at the disposal of the executive, but have often been given to companies of merchants,
## which have always proved in the long run burdensome or useless.
## They are either regulated or joint stock companies.
## Regulated companies are like corporations of trades and act like them.
## There are five existing regulated companies,
## of which the Hamburg, Russian and Estland Companies are merely useless.
## The Turkey Company is a oppressive monopoly.
## Regulated companies are more unfit to maintain forts than joint stock companies,
## but the African company was charged with this duty.
## The status establishing the company endeavoured ineffectually to restrain the spirit of monopoly,
## and Parliament allots £13,000 a year to the company for forts, which sum they misapply.
## Joint stock companies differ from private partnerships:
## (1) withdrawals are by sale of shares:
## (2) liability is limited to the share held.
## Such companies are managed by directors, who are negligent and profuse.
## Some have and some have not exclusive privileges.
## The Royal African Company, having lost exclusive privileges, failed.
## The Hudson's Bay Company have been moderately successful, having in fact an exclusive trade and avery small number of proprietors.
## The South Sea Company failed to make any profit by their annual ship to the Spanish West Indies,
## lost £237,000 in their whale fishery,
## and finally ceased to be a trading company.
## They had competitors in the trade of the annualship.
## The old East India Company, unable to support competition,
## was superseded by the present company,
## which with exclusive privileges have traded sucessfully, but has conquered large terroties,
## and mismanaged them,
## so that Parliament has been obliged to mak alterations,
## which are not likely to be of service.
## They thend to encourage waste,
## and the company is now in greater distress than ever.
## Companies misuse the right of making peace and war.
## The grant of a temporary monopoly to a joint stock company may sometimes be reasonable, but a perpetual monopoly creates an absurd tax.
## A list of fifty0five companies with exclusive privileges for foreign trade which have failed has been collected by Abbe Morellet.
## Only four trades can be well carried on by a company with not exclusive privilege, namely,
## banking,
## insurance,
## canal and aqueduct management and construction.
## A joint stock company outhgt not to be establised except for some purpose of remarkable utility, requiring a larger capital than can be provided by a private partership.
## These conditions are fulfilled by banking,
## insurance,
## canals and water works,
## but not by anyting else.
## ARTICLE II: OF THE EXPENCE OF THE INSTITUTIONS FOR THE EDUCATION OF YOUTH
## Institutions for education may also be made to furnish their own expense,
## or may be endowed.
## Have endownments really promoted useful education?
## Exertion is always in proportion to its necessity.
## Endowments diminish the necessity of application,
## which is not entirely removed where the teacher receives part of his emoluments from fees, but is entirely absent when his whole revenue arises from endowments.
## Members of a college or university are indulgent to their fwllow members.
## External control is ignorant and capricious.
## To compel young men to attend a university has a bad effect on the teachers.
## The provileges of graduates are thus like apprenticeship.
## Scholarships,
## regulations against migration,
## and assignment of students to particular tutors are equally pernicious.
## Where such regulations prevail a teacher may avoid or suppress all visible signs of disapprobation on the part of his pupils.
## University and college discipline is contrived for the ease of the teachers, and quite unnecessary if the teachers are tolerabley diligent.
## The parts of education that are not conducted by public institutions are better taught.
## English public schools, where the teachers depend more upon fees, are less corrupt that the universities.
## What the universities teach badly would not be commonly taught at all but for them.
## The were originally instituted for the education of churchmen in theology;
## for this Latin was necessary,
## but not Greek or Hebrew, which were introduced by the Reformation.
## Greek and Latin continue to be a cojsiderable part of university education.
## There are three branches or Greek philosophy,
## (1) physics or natural philosophy,
## (2) ethics or moral philosophy,
## and (3) logic.
## Philosophy was afterwards divided into five branches, Methphysics or pneumatics were added to physics,
## and gave rise to Ontology.
## Moral philosophy degenerated into casuistry and an ascetic morality,
## the order being (1) logic, (2) ontology, (3) pneumatology, (4) a debased moral philosophy, (5) physics.
## University education was sthus made less likely to produce men of the world.
## This course is still taught in most universities with more or less diligence.
## Few improvements in philosophy have been made by universities, and fewest by the the richest universities.
## In spite of all this the universities drew to themselves the education of gentlemen and men of fortune,
## but in England it is becoming more usual to sand young men to travel abroad, a plan so absurd that nothing but the discredit of the universities could have brought it into repute
## In Greece the state directed education in gymnastics and music.
## The Romans had the Campus Martius, resembling the gymnasium, but not music. They were none the worse for its absence.
## The teachers of military exercises and music were not paid or appointed by the state.
## Reading, writing and arithmetic were taught privtely.
## Philosophical education was independent of the state.
## No public institutions for teaching law existed at Rome, where law was first developed into an orderly system.
## The ancient system was more successful than the modern, which currupts public teaching and stifles private.
## If there were no public institutions for education nothing except what was useful would be taught.
## Women's education is excellent in consequence of the absence of public institutions.
## Ought the state to give no attention to education?
## In some cases it ought, in others it need not.
## Division of labour destroyes intellectual, social and martial virtues unless government takes pains to prevent it,
## whereas in barbarous societies those virtues are kept alive by constant necessity.
## The education of the common people requires attention from the state more than that of people of rank and fortune, whose parents can look after their interests, and who spend their lives in varied occupations chiefly intellectual,
## unlike the children of the poor.
## The state can encourage or insist on the general acquirement of reading, writing, and arithmetic,
## by establishing parish schools,
## giving prizes,
## and requiring men to pass an examination before setting up in trade.
## In this way the Greeks and Romans maintained a martial spirit.
## Martial spirit in the people would diminish both the necessary size and the danger of a standing army.
## The Greek and Roman institutions were more effectual than modern militias, which only include a small portion of the people.
## It is the duty of government to prevent the growth of cowardice,
## gross ignorance and stupidity.
## ARTICLE III: OF THE EXPENCE OF THE INSTITUTIONS FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF PEOPLE OF ALL AGES
## These institutions are chiefly for religious instruction. Relighous like other teachers are more vigorous if unestablished and unendowed.
## The inferior clergy of the Church of Rome are more stimulated by self-interest than those of any establised Protestant Church.
## Hume says the state may leave the promotion of some arts to individuals who benefit by them,
## other must be promoted by the state; it might be tought that the teaching of religion belonged to the first class,
## but it does not, because the interested zeal of the clergy should be discouraged.
## Establishments and public endowments have not been due to resoning like this, but to the needs of political faction.
## If politics had never called in the aid of religion, sects would have been so numerous that they would have learnt to tolerate each other,
## and if they did not, their zeal could do no harm.
## Of the two systems of morality, the strict or austere and the liberal or loose, the first is favoured by the common people, the second by the people of fashion.
## Religious sects usually begin with the austere system,
## and in small religious sects morals are regular and orderly and even disagreeable rigorous and unsocial.
## There are two possible remedies,
## (1) the requirement of a knowledge of science and philosophy from candidates for professions and offices;
## and (2) the encouragement of public diversion.
## Where no religion was favoured the sovereign would not require to influence the teachers of religion,
## as he must where thereis a an established church,
## since he cannot directly oppose the doctrines of the clergy.
## The clergy hold their benefices for lift, and violence used against them would be ineffectual; so management must be resorted to.
## Biships were orginally elected by the clergy and people, afterwards by the clergy alone,
## still later to a large extent by the Pope.
## This, joined with the great wealth of the clergy, rendered them exceedingly formidable.
## Bebefit of clergy and other privileges were the natural result.
## The Church of Rome in the Middle Ages was the most formidable combination against liberty, reason and happiness.
## Its power was destroyed by the improvement of arts, manufactures and commerce.
## The sovereigns endeavoured to deprive the Pope of the disposial of the great benefices, and succeeded, especially in France and England.
## Ever since the French clergy have been less devoted to the Pepe. So even before the Reformation the clergy had less power and inclination to disturb the state.
## The Reformation doctrines were recommended to the common people by the zeal of their teachers
## and enabled sovereigns on bad tems with Rome to overturn the Church with ease,
## while in countries the sovereigns of which were friendly to Rome the Reformation was suppressed or obstructed.
## In some countries the Reformation overtuned both curch and state.
## The follower of the Reformation had no common authority like the court of Rome, and divided into Lutherans and Calvinists.
## The Lutherans and the Church of England preferred episcopacy, and gave the disposal of benefices to the soverign and other lay patrons.
## Zwinglians and Calvinsts gave the right of election to the people, and estalished equiality among the clergy.
## Election by the people gave rise to great disorders,
## and after trial was abolished in Scotland, though the concurrence of the people is still required.
## The equality of the Presbyterian clergy makes them independent and respectable.
## The mediocrity of their benefices gives them influence with the common people.
## It also enables the universities to draw on them for professors, who are thus the most eminent men of letters.
## Eminent men of letters in Greece and Rome were mostly teachers.
## The revenue of the church except that part which arises from endowments is a branch of that of the state.
## In some cantons of Switzerland the old revenue of the church noew maintains both church and state.
## The whole revenue of the Church of Scotland is a trifling amount, but that church produces all possible good effects.
## This is also true in a still higher degree of the Swiss Protestant churches.
## Large revenue is unsuitale to the office of clergyment.
## PART IV: OF THE EXPENCE OF SUPPORTING THE DIGNITY OF THE SOVEREIGN
## The expense of supporting the dignity of the sovereign increases as the expenditure of the people increases,
## and is greater in a monarchy than in a repulic.
## CONCLUSION
## The expense of defence and of maintaining the dignity of the sovereign should be paid by general contribution.
## But the expense of justice my be defrayed by fees of court,
## and expense of local benefit ought to be defrayed by local revenue.
## The expense of roads may not unjustly be defrayed by general contribution, but better by tolls.
## The expense of education and religious instruction may also be defrayed by general contribution, but better by fees and voluntary contribution.
## Any deficiencies in the revenue of institutions beneficial to the whole cosiety must be made up by general contribution.
