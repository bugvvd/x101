# CHAPTER II: OF THE SOURCES OF THE GENERAL OR PUBLIC REVENUE OF THE SOCIETY

## All revenue comes from one or two sources: (1) property belonging to the sovereign: (2) the revenue of the people.
## PART I: OF THE FUNDS OR SOURCES OF REVENUE WHICH MAY PECULIARLY BELONG TO THE SOVEREIGN OR COMMONWEALTH
## The property may be in stock or land.
## Revenue from stock may be profit or interest.
## Tartar and Arabian chiefs make profit from heards and flocks, Hambury from a wine cellar and apothecary's shop, and many states from banks
## and post offices.
## But generally princes are unsucessful as traders.
## The two characters are inconsistent.
## Treasure may be lent to subjects or foreign states:
## Berne lends to foreign states,
## Hamburg has a pawn-shop.
## Pennsylvania lent paper money on land security.
## No greate revenue can be derived from such a source.
## Revenue from land is much more important,
## especially when war cost little, as in ancient Greece and Italy,
## and in feudal times, when all expenses were small.
## The present rent of all the land in the country would not suffice for the ordinary expenditure
## but if the whole of the land of the country were under the extravagant management of state, the rent would be much reduced,
## and the revenue of the people would be reduced by a still greater amount.
## The sale of crown lands would benefit both sovereign and people.
## The revenue from crown lands cost the people more than any other.
## Pblic parks, etc., are the only lands which should belong to the sovergn.
## The greater part of the soverign's expense must be defrayed by taxes.
## PART II: OF TAXES
## Taxes may be intended to fall on rent, profit, or wages, or upon all three sorts of revenue.
## There are four maxims with regard to taxes in general,
## (1) equality,
## (2) certainty,
## (3) convenience of payment,
## and (4) economy in collection,
## which have recommended themselves to all nations.
## ARTICLE I: TAXES UPON RENT. TAXES UP THE RENT OF LAND
## A tax on the rent of land may be on a constant or variable valuation.
## If on a constant valuation it becomes unequal, like the British land tax.
## Circumstances have made the constant valuation favourable to the British landlords, the country having prospered and rents risen,
## and the value of money and silver remained uniform.
## The constancy of valuation might have been very inconvenient to one or oterh of the parties.
## The French economists recommend a tax varying with the rent.
## In the Venetian territory rented lands are taxed 10 per cent. and lands cultivated by the proprietor 8 per cent.
## Such a land tax is more equal but is not so certain, and is more troublesome and expensive than the british.
## The uncertainty and expense could be dimished.
## Leases should be registered,
## fines taxed higher than rent,
## conditions of cultivation should be discouraged by high valuation,
## rents payable in kind should be valued high,
## and an abatement given to landlords cultivating a certain extent of their land.
## Such a system would fee the tax from incovenient uncertainty and encouage improvement.
## The extra expense of levying the tax would be inconsiderable.
## The value of improvements should be for a fixed term exempt from taxation,
## and the tax would then be as little inconvenient as is possible.
## It would adjust itself to all changes.
## Some states make a survery and valuation for the lan tax,
## for example, Prussiam
## Silesia,
## and Bohemia.
## Under the Prussian land tax the church lands are taxed higher than the rest; in some states they are taxed lower thant the rest.
## Differences are often made between land held by noble and base tenures.
## A land tax assessed according to a general survery and valuation soon becomes unequal,
## as in Montauban.
## TAXES WHICH ARE PROPORTIONED, NOT TO THE RENT, BUT TO THE PRODUCE OF LAND
## Taxes on the produce are finall paid by the lanlord,
## and are very unequal taxes,
## which discourage both improvement and good cultivation.
## They form the principal revenue of the state in many Asiatic countries,
## and are said to interest the sovereign in the improvement and cultivation of land there.
## They may be in kand or in money,
## Collection in kind is quite unsuitable for public revenue.
## A money tax on produce may be always the same or may vary with the market price of produce.
## When a certain sum of money is to be paid in compensation for the tax it becomes exactly like the english land tax.
## TAXES UPON THE RENT OF HOUSES
## Houses rent consists of two parts,
## building rent,
## and ground rent.
## A tax on house rent paid by the tenant falls partly on the inhabitant and partly on the owner of the ground,
## as may be shown by an example.
## On the inhabitants it would be an unequal tax, falling heaviest on the rich.
## It would be like a tax on any other consumable commodity, it would be very much inproportion to men's who expense, and it would produce considerable revenue.
## The rent could be easily ascertained. Empty houses should be exempt, and houses occupied by their proprietor should be assessed at their letting value.
## Ground rent is a still more proper subject of taxation than building rent,
## as no discouragement is given to industry by the taxation of the rent of land.
## Ground rents are even a more proper subject of taxation than ordinary land rents.
## Ground rents are nowhere separately taxed, but might be.
## House rent is legally liable to the British land tax.
## In Holland there is a tax on the capital value of houses.
## Houses taxes in England have not been proportioned to the rent,
## but first to the number of hearths,
## and later to the number of windows.
## The present window tax augments gradually from 2d per window to 2s.
## Window taxes are objectionable, chiefly on the ground of inequality.
## Taxes on houses lower rents.
## ARTICLE II: TAXES UPON PROFIT, OR UPON REVENUE ARISING FROM STOCK
## Profit is divided into interest and surplus over interest.
## The surplus is not taxable.
## Interest at first sight seems as fit to be taxed as rent,
## but it is not, since,
## (1) the amount received by an individual cannot be readily and exactly ascertained,
## and (2) stock may be removed from the country imposing the tax.
## Where such a tax exists it is levied on a loose and very low valuation, 
## as under the English land tax.
## Inquisition is avoided.
## At Hamburg each inhabitant privately assesses himself on oath.
## In some Swiss cantons each man assesses himself publicly,
## which would be a hardship at Hamburg.
## Holland once adopted the Hamburg practice.
## On that occasion the tax was meant to be a tax on the capital.
## TAXES UPON THE PROFIT OF PARTICULAR EMPLOYMENTS
## Taxes are sometimes imposed on particular profits,
## such as those on hawkers, pedlars, etc.
## These fall not on the dealers but on the consumers of the goods,
## but when not proportioned to the trade of the dealer they oppress the small and favour the general dealer.
## The personal taille in France on the profits of agriculture is arbitrary and uncertain.
## The authority which assesses it is always ignorant of the real abilities of the contributors and often misled by friendship, party animosity and private resentment.
## Taxes on the profits of agriculture do not, like those on profits of other trades, fall on the consumer, but on the landlord.
## The discouragement to good cultivation caused by the personal taille injures the public, the farmer and the lanlord.
## Per capita taxes on negro slaves fall on the landlords.
## Poll taxes have been represented as badges of slavery, but, to the tax payer every tax is badge of liberty.
## Taxes on menial servants are like taxes on consumable commodities.
## Taxes on particular profits cannot affect interest.
## APPENDIX TO ARTICLES I AND II: TAXES UPON THE CAPITAL VALUE OF LAND, HOUSES, AND STOCK
## Taxes on the transmission of property often necessarily take a part of the capital value.
## Transfers from the dead to the living and all transfers of immovable property can be taxed directly; transfers by way of load of money have been taxed by stamp duties or duties on registration.
## Transfers from the dead to the living were taxed by the Vicesima Hereditatum,
## and the Dutch tax on successions.
## The feudal law taxed the transference of land, by wardships and reliefs,
## and fines on alienation, which last still form a considerable branch of revenue in many countries.
## These taxes on the sale of land may be levied by stamps or duties on registration.
## In Great Britain the duties are not proportioned to the value of the property.
## In Holand some are proportioned and others not
## In France different sets of officers collect the stamp duties and the registration duties.
## Both stamps and registration duties are modern methods of taxation.
## Taxes on transfers from the dead to the living fall on the person who acquires the property; taxes on sales on land fall on the saller;
## taxes on the sale of new buildings fall on the buyer;
## taxes on the sale of old houses fall on the seller;
## taxes on the sale of ground rents fall on the seller; taxes on loans fall on the borrower; taxes on law proceedings fall on the suitors.
## All taxes on transfers, so far as they diminsh the capital value, are unthrifty/
## Even when proportioned to the value of the property they are unequal, becauses the frequency of transfer varies. They are certain, convenient and inexpensive.
## French stamp-duties on transfers are not much complained of, but the registration duties (or Controle) are said to be arbitrary and uncertain.
## Public registration of mortgages and all rights to immovable property is advantageous, but secret registers ought mot to exist.
## Many stamp-duties are duties on consumption.
## ARTICLE III: TAXES UPON THE WAGES OF LABOUR
## A tax on wages must raise wages by rather more than the amount of the tax.
## The rise in the wages of manufacturing labour would be advanced by the employers and paid by the consumers, and the rise in agricultural wages advanced by the farmers and paid by the landlords.
## The effect of the tax in raising wages is generally disguised by the fall in the demand for labour which it occasions.
## A tax on agricultural wages raises prices no more than one on farmer's profits.
## Many countries have such taxes, e.g., France and Bohemia.
## A tax on the recompense of the liberal professions, etc., would also raise that recompense, but a tax on government offices would not raise salaries.
## ARTICLE IV: TAXES WHICH, IT IS INTENDED, SHOULD FALL INDIFFERENTLY UPON EVERY DIFFERENT SPECIES OF REVENUE
## These are capitatino taxes and taxes on consumable commodities.
## CAPITATION TAXES
## Capitation taxes ostensibly proportioned to revenue are altogether arbitrary.
## I fproportioned to rank they are unequal.
## In the first case they are always grievous and in the second they are intolarable unless they are light.
## In the poll taxes of William III. accessment was chiefly according to rank.
## In France the assessment is by rank in the higher and by supposed fortune in the lower orders of people.
## The French tax is more rigorously exacted than the English taxes were.
## Capitation taxes on the lower orders of people are like taxes on wages.
## They are inexpensive and afford a sure revenue.
## TAXES UPON CONSUMABLE COMMODITIES
## The impossibility of taxation according to revenue has given rise to taxation according to expenditure on sonsumable commodities, either necessaries or luxuries, necessaries including all that creditable people of the lowest order cannot decently go without.
## What rauses the price of subsistence must raise wages.
## So that a tax on necessaries, like a tax on wages, raise wages.
## Taxes on luxuries even if consumed by the poor have no such effect,
## as they act like sumptuary laws, and so do not diminish the ability of the poor to bring up useful families,
## whereas a rise in the price of necessaries diminishes the ability of the poor to bring up useful families and supply the demand for labour.
## Taxes on necessaries are contrary to the interest of the middle and superior ranks of people.
## The chief British taxes on necessaries are those on salt, leather, soap and candles,
## and also seaborne coal.
## Such taxes at any rate bring in revenue, which is more than can be said of the regulations of the corn trade, etc., which produce equally bad effects.
## Much higher taxes on necessaries prevail in many other countries. There are taxes on bread,
## and meat.
## A tax on a consumable commodity may be levied either periodically from the consumer or once for all from the dealer when the consumer acquires it.
## The first method is best when the commodity is durable.
## Sir M. ecker proposed to adape it also to other commodities by issuing anuual licences to consume them, but this would be liable to greater objections thant the seocnd and usual method.
## Excepting the four mentioned above, British excise duties fall chiefly on luxuries.
## Customs were orginally regarded as taxes on merchants' profits,
## those of aliens being taxed more heavily.
## So originally customs were imposed equally on all sorts of goods, and on exports as well as imports.
## The first was that on wool and leather; and the second tonnage (on wine) and oundage (on all other goods). Subsidies were addition to poundage.
## The prevalence of the principles of the mercantile system has led to the removal of nearly all the export duties,
## and has been unfavourable to the revenue of the state,
## annihilating parts of it by prohibitions of importation, and reducing other parts by high duties.
## Bounties and drawbacks (great par of which is obtained by fraud) and expenses of management make a large deduction from the customs revenue.
## In the customs returns the imports are minimised and the exports exaggerated.
## The customs are very numerous and much less perspicuous and distince than the excise duties.
## They might with great advantage be confined to a few articles.
## Foreign wines and brandies and East and West Indian products at present yield most of the customs revenue.
## The yield of high duties is often lessened by smuggling or diminished consumption.
## In the first case the only remedy is to lower the duty.
## For smuggling the remedy is to lower the tax or increase the difficulty of smuggling.
## Excuse laws are more embarrassing to the smuggler than the customs.
## If customs were confined to a few articles, a system of excise supervision of stores could be instituted.
## Great simplification without loss of revenue would the be securied,
## while the trade and manufactures of the country would gain greatly.
## Sir Robert Walpole's excise scheme was something of this kind so far as wine and tobacco are concerned.
## The duities on foreign luxuries fall chiefly on the middle and upper ranks.
## Those on the luxuries of home produce fall on people of all ranks.
## Taxes on the consumption of the inferior ranks are much more productive than those on the consumption of the rich.
## But such taxes must never be on the necessary consumption of the inferior ranks.
## Liquors brew or distilled for private use are exempt from excise, though a composition must be paid for malting.
## It is said that a tax on malt smaller than the present taxes on malt, beer and ale taken together would bring in more revenue,
## and figures are quoted to prove it.
## Taxes on cyder and mum included in the old malt tax are conterbalanced by the "country excise" duty on cyder, verjuice, vinegar and mead.
## If the malt tax were raised, it would be proper to reduce the excises on wines and spirits containing malt,
## but not so as to reduce the price of spirits.
## Dr. Davenant objects that the maltster's profit would be unfirly taxed, and the rent and profit of barley land reduced, but the change would make malt liquors cheaper, and so be likely to increase the consumption,
## and the malster could recover eighteen shillings as easily as the brewer at present recovers twenty-four or thirty and might be given longer credit.
## The consumption of barley not being reduced, the rent and profit of barley land could not be reduced, as there is no monopoly.
## The only sufferers would be those who brew for private use.
## Tolls on goods carried from place to place affect prices unequally.
## Some countries levy transit duties on foreign goods.
## Taxes on luxuries do not reach absentees, but the fact that they are paid voluntarily recommends them.
## They are also certain
## and payable at convenient times,
## but take much more from the people than they yield to the state, since
## (1) the salaries and perquisites of cunstoms and excis officers take a large proportion of what is collected;
## (2) particular branches of industry are discouraged;
## (3) smuggling is encouraged;
## and (4) vexation equivalent to expense is caused by the tax-gatherers' exnubatuibs and visits.
## Great Britain suffers less than other countries from these inconveniencies.
## Duties on commodities are sometimes repeated on each sale, as by the spanish Alcavala,
## and the 3 per cent. tax at Naples.
## Great advantage is obtained by the uniformity of taxation in Great Britain.
## In France the diversity of taxes in different provinces occasions may hindrances to internal trade,
## and the commerce in wine is subject to particular restraints.
## Milan and Parma are still more absurdly managed.
## The collection of taxes by government officiers is much superior to letting the taxes to farm.
## Farmers of taxes require sanguinary revenue laws.
## Taxations by monopoly let to farm is even worse.
## In France the three branches of revenue which are levied by government officers are much more economical.
## The taille and capitations should be abolised, the vintiemes in creased, that taxes on commodities made uniform, and farming abolished.
## The French system is in every respect inferior to the British.
## In Holland heavy taxes on necessaries have ruined manufactures.
## But perhaps Holland has done the best possible.
