# CHAPTER III: OF PUBLIC DEBTS

When expensive luxuries are unknown, persons with large revenue are likely to hoard savings.
So the ancient sovereigns of Europe amassed treasures.
When luxuries are introduced, the sovereign;s expenditure equals his revenue in time of peace,
and in time of war he contracts debts.
The same causes which make borrowing necessary make it possible.
Merchants and manufacturers are able to lend,
and also willing.
A government dispenses itself from saving if it knows it can borrow,
whereas if there is no possibility of borrowing, it feels it must save.
Nations have begun to borrow without special security and have afterwards mortgaged particular funds.
The unfunded debt of Great Britain is contracted in the first way.
Mortgages of particular branches of revenue are either for a term of years, when money is said to be raised by anticiptation, or in perpetuity, when it is said to be raised by funding.
The annual land and malt taxes are always anticipated.
Under William III. and Anne anticipations gave rise to deficiencies,
and the term of the mortgage taxes was prolonged in 1697,
in 1701,
in 1707,
in 1708，
in 1709.
and in 1710.
In 1711 the taxes were continued for ever and made into a fund for paying the interest on £9,177,968.
The only earlier taxes imposed in perpetuity to pay interest on debt were those for paying interest on the advances of the Bank and East India Compnay.
In 1715 several taxes were accumulated into the Aggregate Fund,
and in 1717 several others into the General Fund.
Thus most of the anticipated taxes were made into a fund for paying interest only.
When once become familiar, perpetual funding is preferred to anticipation.
A fall in the market rate of interest led to a saving which gave rise to the Sinking Fund.
A sinking fund facilitates the contraction of new debt.
Money is also borrowed by terminable and life annuities.
Under William III. and Anne large sums were borrowed on annuities for terms of years.
But little money was so borrowed in the wars of the middle of the eighteenth century, most people preferring a perpetual annuity,
and annuities for terms and for lives wre only given as premiums.
Tontines are preferred to annuties on separate lives, though they do not liberate the public revenue so quickly.
In France a much greater proportion of the whole debt is in life annunities than in England;
the difference is due to the fact that in England the lenders are merchants,
whereas in France they are perons engaged in the farming and collection of the taxes, who are chiefly bachelors.
The system of perpetual funding prevents the people from feeling distinctly the burden of war.
Their burdens are not reduced on the conclusion of peace.
Any new taxes imposed are rarely sufficient to do more than pay the new interest. Sinking funds arise generally from reduction of interest,
and are constantly misapplied.
The British debt had its origin in the war of 1688-97,
which left a debt of twenty-on and a half millions. This was reduced by five millions in 1697-1701. From 1702 to 1722 the increase was thirty-nine millions, and from 1722 to 1739 the reduction was only eight and one-third millions.
From 1739 to 1748 the increase was thirty-one and one-third millions.
During the peace of 1748-55 the reduction was six millions, and the seven years' war added more than seventy-five.
In the eleven years of peace before Janyart 1775 the reduction was only ten and a half millions, and most of this was due to reductions of interest.
The opinion that the national debt is an additional capital is altogether erroneous.
When necessary expenditure is met by taxes, it only diverts unproductive labour from one unproducttive employment to another.
When it is met by borrowing, it diverts labour from productive to unproductive employment, and the only advantage is that people can continue to save more during the war,
which advantage disappears immediately peace is concluded. Under the other system, too, wars would be shorter and periods of peace longer.
Moreover funding at length burdens the revenue so greatly that the ordinary peace expenditure exceeds that which would under the other system have been sufficient in war.
The fact of part or the whole of the debt being held at home makes no difference.
Land and capital, the two original sources of all revenue, are managed by landlords and owners of capital.
Taxation may diminish or destroy the landlord's ability to improve his land,
and incude the owner of the capital to remove it from the country.
The transference of the sources of revenue from the owners of particular portions of them to the creditors of the public must occasion neglect of land and waste or removal of capital.
The practice of funding has always enfeebled states.
The superiority of the British system of taxation will not enable Britain to support an unlimited burden.
Bankruptcy is always the end of great accumulation of debt.
Raising the coin has been the usual method of disguising bankruptcy though this expedient has much worse consequences than open bankruptcy.
It has been adopted by many states, including ancient Rome,
and has led to the universal reduction of the value of the coin.
Another expedient is to adulterate the coin,
but this is a treacherous fraud which occasions such indignation that it usually fails.
It has been tried in England, Scotland and most other countries.
For the paying off or reduction of the British debt a very considerable increase of revenue or diminution of expense is necessary.
Alterations in taxation might increase the revenue considerable but not suffciently.
An extension of taxation to Ireland and the colonies would afford a larger increase.
The land-tax could well be extended to Ireland, America and the West Indies.
Stamp duties could easily be extended.
The extension of the customs would be of great advantage to all, as it would be accomopanied by an extension of free trade.
Excise duties would require some variation,
as for example in the case of American beer.
Sugar, rum and tobacco could be made subject to excise.
The increase of revenue thus obtained, if proportionate to the increased population taxed, would yield six millions and a quarter to be applied in reduction of debt, and this sum would of course be a growing one.
Some necessary deductions from this estimate would be counterbalanced by additions resulting from a few simpl alterations.
The Americans have little gold and silver,
but this is the effect of choice, not necessity.
Paper is more convenient to the Americans for home trade,
while for their external trade they use as much gold and silver as is necessary.
In the trade between Great Britain and Virginia and Maryland tobacco is a more convenient currency than gold and silver.
The northern colonies generally find the gold and silver necessary to pay the balance on their trade with Great Britain.
The sugar colonies generally find the gold and silver necessary to pay the balance to Great Britain which arises fom the sugar planters being absentees.
Any difficulties have not been proportionate to this size of the balance due,
and have arisen from unnecessary and excessive enterprise.It is justice that Ireland and America should contribute to the discharge of the British debt.
Union would deliver Ireland from an oppressive aristocracy founded on religious and political prejudices.
The colonies would be delivered from rancorous factions which are likely to lead to bloodshed in case of separation from great Britain.
East Indiawith lighter taxes and less corrupt administration might yield an even larger addition of revenue.
If no such augmentation of revenue can be obtained Great Britain should reduce her expenses by ridding herself of the coast of the colonies in peace and war.
