# INTRODUCTION AND PLAN OF THE WORK

## The produce of annual labour supplies annual consumption, 
## better or worse according to the proportion of produce to people,
## which proportion is regulated by the skill, etc., of the labour and the proportion of useful labourers,
## and more by the skill, etc., than by the proportion of useful labourers, as is shown by the greater produce of sivilised societies.
## The cause of improvement and natural distribution are the subject of Book I. Capital stock, which regulates the proportion of useful labourers, is treated in Book II.
## The circumstances which led Europe to encourage the industry of the towns and discourage agriculture are dealt with in Book III.
## The theories to which different policies have given rise are explained in Book IV.
## The expenditure, revenue and debts are treated of in Book V.
